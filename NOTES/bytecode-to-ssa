Bytecode-to-ssa translation.

Place phi functions at merge nodes for all variables going through it.
(live in the stack.)
It is a standard optimization to remove phi functions where all arguments
are identical; this will reduce the graph to minimal-phi SSA form.
already have branch and join nodes.
Use bytecode type information only to determine behaviour of stack-weird
opcodes.
