Generally, tasks-all should contain the list of all tasks that are usually run (daily, for instance), and tasks-selected should be a sublist of tasks-all, representing the tasks that should be run more rarely (weekly, for example).

mailto-all, mailto-selected     -- Contain the list of people that the results should be mailed to. Generally, mailto-all should contain the list of all people interested in usual results (from daily runs, for example) and mailto-selected should be a sublist of mailto-all, representing all people to whom some more specific results should be mailed (results from weekly runs, for example).
