===============================
1. HOW TO MAKE EVERYTHING WORK
===============================

1.1. cvs update this directory.
1.2. Copy the .regtestrc file to your home directory.
1.3. If you're using the bash shell, then simply add this line at the end of you .bashrc file:

	. $HOME/.regtestrc

     If you're using a different shell, then edit the $HOME/.regtestrc file (it should be very easy, since the only thing it does is exporting some variables) and make sure it is executed everytime when you log in.
1.4. Make sure you can cvs update FLEX without typing your password. In order to do this, you'll to make your ssh-agent work with lesser-magoo.lcs.mit.edu. Read ../Driver/SSH-INSTALL for more information about ssh-agent.
