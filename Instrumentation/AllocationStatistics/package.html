This package contains code for instrumenting the allocation sites from
a program in order to measure how many times each allocation site is
executed (ie, how many objects are allocated at each allocation site).
The main instrumentation class is <code>InstrumentAllocs</code>; it
has additional support for instrumenting the call instructions.

<p>
Here is a typical usage scenario of this package:

<ol>

<li>Create an <code>AllocationNumbering</code> object that assigns to
each allocation site a program-wide unique ID.

<li>Produce an <code>HCodeFactory</code> that provides the
instrumented version of the code (to do this, create an
<code>InstrumentAllocs</code> object and next call its
<code>codeFactory</code> method). In the instrumented code, each
allocation site is wrapped in code that increments the counter for the
corresponding unique ID.

<li>Serialize the program representation (the linker, the
<code>HCodeFactory</code> for the uninstrumented code, the set of
roots and the initial method) and the <code>AllocationNumbering</code>
object.

<li>Compile the instrumented version of the program.

<li>Execute the resulting executable; when it finishes, it dumps out a
file that specifies for each unique allocation site ID, how many times
the corresponding allocation site was executed.

<li>Deserialize the program representation and the
<code>AllocationNumbering</code> object.  This gives both the
original, uninstrumented, <code>HCodeFactory</code>, and the mapping
between allocation sites and unique IDs.

<li>Finally, create an <code>AllocationStatistics</code> object by
providing to its constructor the deserialized
<code>AllocationNumbering</code> object and the name of the file
produced by the instrumentation.  The resulting
<code>AllocationStatistics</code> object provides, for each allocation
site, the number of times it was executed.  It does this by computing
the jointure between the <code>AllocationNumbering</code> mapping and
the mapping obtained by parsing the file produced by the
instrumentation.

</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> This scenario is complicated because we need to
preserve the identity of the allocation sites between two different
runs of FLEX: before and after the instrumented version if compiled
and executed.

<p>
The above scenario is an ideal one.  In practice, JVMs are buggy when
it comes to (de)serialization.  Therefore, we designed an alternative
solution that uses <i>textualization</i> (a hacked-down way of
serializing the <code>AllocationNumbering</code> map; don't bother
about its details).  Here are the differences from the ideal solution:

<ol>

<li>Follow the same steps, with the two exceptions indicated below:

<li>Don't serialize anything.  Instead, textualize the
<code>AllocationNumbering</code> object by using the
<code>AllocationNumberingStub.writeToFile</code> method.

<li>Don't deserialize anything.  Instead, recreate the uninstrumented
program representation from scratch (in exactly the same way you
produced the one that was later instrumented), and create an
<code>AllocationStatistics</code> object by using the constructor that
requires the name of the file used for textualization
(internally, it will detextualize an
<code>AllocationNumberingStub</code> object).  Now, you should have a
nice, ready to use <code>AllocationStatistics</code> object.

</ol>

A full example can be found in <code>SAMain</code> (search for
<code>AllocationNumbering</code>).
