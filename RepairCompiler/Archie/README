ARCHIE Compiler
  
written by: 
  Daniel Roy and Brian Demsky

Instructions: 
  To run the compiler, you must have java 1.4.1.  To compile the FreeCiv
  specifications, type the following command at the command-line prompt:
  
  java -jar MCC.jar specs/freeciv
  
  The compiler outputs a C source-code file, specs/freeciv.cc. This file
  is #include'd in the calltool.cc/.h source file which can be compiled
  alongside the SimpleHash.cc/.h and linked with FreeCiv. We do not
  distribute FrleeCiv which is freely-available. The use of calltool
  should be fairly self-explanatory. We provide a bash "build" script
  that runs the compiler on the FreeCiv specs, compiles calltool and
  SimpleHash and builds a library, libchecker.a, which you can link with
  FreeCiv.

  All optimizations described in the paper are turned on by default. For
  more information, please contact the author, Daniel Roy, at
