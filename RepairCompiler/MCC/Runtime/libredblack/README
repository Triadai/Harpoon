===========

This a small library that provides the red-black balanced tree algorithm

If this code is raw out of the CVS tree, you will have to do the following to
compile it:-

sh ./autogen.sh

NOTE: When you have done a 'make install', you should check that /etc/ld.so.conf
contains the directory /usr/local/lib, and you should also probably run
/sbin/ldconfig to make sure that ld.so's cache file is up to date.
