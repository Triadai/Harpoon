algorithm:

a. if quantifiers are empty than rule has no dependencies
b. if not ( x in Set ) or relation than dependent on everything that
   touches the Set or Relation (also known as delayed).
c. otherwise, if set or relation mentioned in quantifier, edge between
   that rule and any rule who modifies that set or relation (in the 
   inclusion constraint portion of any rule)

algorithm:

a. if quantifier mentions a set, include all rules that touch that set
   or its subsets/partitions
b. if the body mentions a set or relation, add that an edge to any rule
   that touches those sets or relations
