This is Video Capture class using Video4Linux. 
I developed with WipeOut1.4.6pro
on GNU/Debian Linux 2.1 Japanese extention (Slink-JP) 
and Kernel 2.2.3-ac1. 

supported device: 
Bt848
  Althogh I checked Justy JVC-02, perhaps almost Bt848 chip boards 
  will be able... 
Quickcam-Black and White
  !NOTE! highly recommed Kernel 2.2.3-ac1 if you use this one. 

THis class is free using for all Java lovers and Linux lovers.
This will work on Kernel 2.2.1 heigher and JDK 1.1.7 heigher.
But I don't have no resonsebility that all troubles using this.
Also non-commacial using only.
Please feel free to contact me by email if you have a question or 
report. However, I may not be able to answer perfectly because this
is my first programming work for public:-)

Have fun!

<HOW TO USE>
Did kernel recognized caputure device which you have?
Did you install JDK?
Anyhow you want to try soon?
OK!
First, put libvideo_capture.so and libvideo_capture.so.0.1 in some 
directory setted by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
Next type:
    java TestBt848
or
    java TestQCBW
in the directory which have Test*.class. You will get a shapshot 
in AWT window.
Also, you can check device infomation
    java ShowDevInfo
That's all;-)

<HOW TO MAKE>
If you make *.class and *.so from src by yourself, please type:
    make clean
    make shared_lib
    make java
If you can't make it unfortunately, Please modify -I, -l or "javac" 
path in Linux.def.
