/* further work:
1) is this powerful enough?  will it handle the tricky ARM cases?
2) is this compact enough?  do we need to write a lot of repeated code/elements
3) is this clear?
4) is this complete: are there Tree forms that don't work easily.
think also about typing:
  MEM
  MEM32
  MEM64
  MEMI
  MEMF
  MEM32I
  MEM32F
  MEM64I
  MEM64F
