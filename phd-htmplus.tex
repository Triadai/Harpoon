% First: do we want to?  Next section should how to make software hybrid.

\section{Adding partial rollback}
\subsection{LTM}
% keep a log(n) bit 'nesting level' with each transaction
% bulk decremember nesting level on commit.

% numbering of the tree, so that we have well-spaced checkpoints.

\subsection{UTM}
% think about implications here.

\section{Making abort handlers more general}
% calling-convention and function issues.
% save registers in software
% do aborts in software
% this lets us add custom compensation code.
% what environment?  just pick one.
