Some notes about a ``real'' implementation of UTM.

MIPS.  Let's assume a primary cache line of 16 bytes, and a secondary
cache line of 128 bytes.  Our transaction block size will be the same
as the secondary cache line size, 128-bytes, which will limit our
address-space overhead to approximately 8\%.  The transaction data (descriptor)
associated with a block will fit into 8 bytes (one 64-bit word), since
virtual addresses are limited to 40 bits on MIPS (42 if you include
the kernel/supervisor/user mode bits; AMD-64 has 52-bit virtual
addresses).\footnote{A(63:62)=$10_2$ is not currently used; we could
steal this to indicate ``transaction descriptors''.  This would probably
cause protection problems.}

There would be 16 transaction descriptor words on a cache line; this
could cause ping-ponging.  An 8k page contains descriptors for the
transaction blocks on 16 other pages ($2^10$ descriptors).  The
descriptors should be arranged so the ``no information'' is an
all-zeros pattern.  The OS can then garbage collect any transaction
descriptor pages which contain all zeros (instead of eg paging them to
disk; I believe most OSes will do this optimization already, but maybe
not if the page was once dirty).\footnote{Alternatively, we could reference
count these pages in the page table, and deallocate them when the
number of non-zero entries on the page drops to zero.  This is
probably not the best way to do it.}

To find the transaction descriptor for a given virtual address, we
just flip a high-order bit and shift the low-order bits.  This reuses
the TLB, etc, mechanisms for virtualization, but we must be careful
that we can still ensure forward progress and don't introduce spurious
transaction performance conflicts (because transaction descriptors for
two different transactions reside on the same cache line).

The caches need to know the details of these 'special' addresses so
that ``on chip'' transactions are handled correctly.  In fact, the
cache organization would probably look more like the figure (with the
information stored alongside the cache lines), and we might want to
have extra cache-associativity or other mechanisms to prevent
ping-ponging of the transaction descriptors. (Is this right?)


Another alternative: 9-bit bytes would give enough transaction
descriptor info for 64-byte transaction blocks.
