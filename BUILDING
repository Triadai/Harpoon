Make sure that JacORB 1.3.30 is in your CLASSPATH, and
some 1.4 compliant JDK and JVM.

(Currently works with SunJDK 1.4 and HotSpot - 
FLEX and GNU Classpath support should be added soon.)

Type 'make' to build the program and documentation.

Point your browser to doc/index.html for the main program documentation.

Type 'make run', 'java -jar imagerec.jar', or 'jar -x imagerec.jar'

src/MANIFEST.MF points to the Main class to be run.

To run as part of the BBN UAV OEP code, use
jaco imagerec.Main -ORBInitRef NameService=..., and
make sure imagerec.jar is in your CLASSPATH.
