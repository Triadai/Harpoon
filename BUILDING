Make sure that some 1.4 compliant JDK and JVM is in your CLASSPATH.

(Currently works with SunJDK 1.4 and HotSpot - 
FLEX and GNU Classpath support should be added soon.)

Type 'make jars' to build the documentation and entry points.

Point your browser to doc/index.html for the main program documentation.

Type 'java -jar x.jar' to run an entry point.  It will display
more detailed usage information.

ATR.jar          - The main ATR as a single component.
embeddedATR.jar  - The embedded component of the two-stage version of the ATR
                   (only greatest 'bang/buck' algorithms here - the goal is
                    to reduce bandwidth requirements by sending only compressed 
                    streams of tracked "interesting" objects across the network 
                    and use the minimum number of cycles to do it).

groundATR.jar    - The ground component of the two-stage version of the ATR.
                   (the more sensitive, slower algorithms here - the goal is to
                    make sure the "interesting" tracked objects are actually tanks,
                    and then inform the embedded version of this identification
                    so that it can stop using bandwidth to track non-tanks.)

GUI.jar          - A version which pops open a display to demonstrate the image recognition
                   pipeline circling the tank using pipelines from the single ATR.

ns.jar           - An easy-to-use front-end for the JacORB CORBA NameService
trackerStub.jar  - The ALERT server.
receiverStub.jar - Sends images to the ATR.

RTJ.jar          - The version of the single ATR which uses Real-Time Java 

imagerec.jar     - The current development head for experimenting with new pipelines.
Buffer.jar	 - An ATR with a buffer at the front of it.
Watermark.jar	 - A test pipeline for the watermarking node.
ATR.jar, GUI.jar, ns.jar, trackerStub.jar, receiverStub.jar, 
embeddedATR.jar, groundATR.jar, Buffer.jar and Watermark.jar  are the
currently working jars as of this release.
RTJ.jar is under development.

See src/Main.java for many other MUCH more sophisticated pipelines
involving line recognition, template matching based on outlines, 
polygon generation, matching of orientation with tracked 
direction of movement, etc.  Also, see the program documentation in
doc/index.html under imagerec.graph for a description of the 
algorithms currently under development.

Current publically-available pipelines:
1) Recognize the tank by size.
2) Recognize the tank by color.
3) Recognize the tank by both color and size.

The current publically-available pipelines in the single ATR are scheduled for introduction
in the embedded version of the two-stage ATR.

Example #1 (no CORBA):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
java -jar GUI.jar pause nocorba 3 

Locally, you can run this as:
java -jar GUI.jar nopause nocorba 3


Example #2 (with CORBA):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the .jacorb_properties file from contrib/ to your home directory
and modify the ORBInitRef.NameService= to point to the name service.

Start the JacORB NameService:
  java -jar ns.jar /users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the ALERT server:
  java -jar trackerStub.jar timer "ATR Alert" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the ATR:
  java -jar ATR.jar timer 3 "LMCO ATR" "ATR Alert" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb
 
Send images to the ATR:
  java -jar receiverStub.jar GUI.jar tank.gz 533 1 "LMCO ATR" "placeholder" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Note: Use the CORBA names "LMCO ATR" and "ATR Alert" only for drop-in compatibility 
with the existing Lockheed-Martin ATR.


Example #3 (with CORBA, using multiple ATR stages):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the .jacorb_properties file in your home directory to point to
your name service.

Start the JacORB NameService:
   java -jar ns.jar /users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the ALERT server:
   java -jar trackerStub.jar "ATR Alert" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the ReceiverClient:
   java -jar receiverStub.jar GUI.jar tank.gz 533 2 "LMCO ATR" "ATR Feedback" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the Embedded ATR:
   java -jar embeddedATR.jar notimer nopause headless 1 "LMCO ATR" "embedToGround" "groundToEmbed" "ATR Alert" "ATR Feedback" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Start the Ground ATR:
  java -jar groundATR.jar notimer headless 1 "embedToGround" "groundToEmbed" -ORBInitRef NameService=file://users/wbeebee/.jacorb

Wierdness:
~~~~~~~~~
Note: Use the CORBA names "LMCO ATR" and "ATR Alert" only for drop-in compatibility 
with the existing Lockheed-Martin ATR.

For complicated objects on some systems, you may need to specify the -Xss1M option to increase the 
Java thread stack size to 1M:
java -Xss1M ...

Also, if you're using the TAO NameService instead of the JacORB NameService,
you may have to use -DORBInitRef.NameService:
java -DORBInitRef.NameService=...

However, if you're trying to connect to the JacORB NameService, do not
use the -DORBInitRef.NameService option, as it will cause a NullPointerException 
in JacORB.

Oddly, JacORB sometimes seems to work improperly if the .jacorb_properties NameService is different
from the one specified at the command line.  

Use -Djava.compiler=none for interpreted mode instead of the HotSpot JIT or for debugging if you
need to.  Note that interpreted code runs slower than JIT'ed code.

See the JacORB manual at http://www.jacorb.org/docs/ProgrammingGuide_1_4_1.pdf for more information.
(Also note that that's the manual for 1.4.1, not 1.3.30.)

For main development, develop in src/Main.java and use 'make' and 'make run'
