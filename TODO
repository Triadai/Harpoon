Change PHI implementation to not make phi function entries for
local variables that have not yet been defined.  Change State initialization
to put 'null' in undefined local variables.
---- Sep-09-98
Undo MONITOR block transform.  Make it a poor statement.
Change DCMPL/DCMPG/FCMPL/FCMPG bytecode operations to
conform to the integer standard: _CMPEQ, _CMPGE, _CMPGT.

X Add FOOTER block to allow reverse traversals.
X Fix RET handling -- RET should return to source of JSR.
Fix the way the 'any exception' try is handled 
X Check assumption that 'any' == Throwable in exception handler description.
Make list of exception handling statements in translate phase so we can
 strip them all out when regenerating java.  obviously try/catch block-related
 statements must stay.
X Make monitor blocks work.
X Enclose synchronized methods in monitor blocks.
Runtime exception check on MONITOREXIT.

Figure out if we really need JMP/NOP/LET quads.

Test:
 method() {
   synchronized(new Object()) {
     synchronized(new Object()) {
     }
   }
 }
Test:
 method() {
  try {
   try {
    ;
   } catch (x) {
   }
  } catch (y) {
  }
 }

X Implement INSTANCEOF in the IR (special method? special Quad? subclass OPER?)
X Implement CHECKCAST
O Make Temps into Leafs in Quad rep.
  [made Leafs into Temps...]

---- Aug-7-98
O Figure out how classes will be laid out in the JavaChip.
X Figure out what we're doing about arrays.

---- Aug-5-98
X Fix munge/unmunge to be pipeline-safe

---- Aug-3-98
X Finish InCti class.

X Interface should have:
X   convert method, to go from one form to another.
X    (automagic chaining, if each form just knows one other source form&convers.)
X  line number method.
X  enumeration method.
X  name method (of course) -- (change putCode)

X Add new interface type for primitive types (simplify isPrimitive)
O   only one method in interface: getDescriptor();
O each type has value/add/sub/etc methods that are *not in interface*
O   because return value is of the same primitive type (ie, not object)
O   see java.lang.reflect rules for encapsulating return values.
O   want to be able to specify that type is Z, not java.lang.Boolean obj.
O   think this one over.
O Easy.  Superclass basic java language type objects with our special
O  'primary type' object.  Then we can easily tell which is which.
O  (we can also add cool add/sub/etc functions while we're at it.)

X Make --CUTHERE-- file joiner/separator (perl?)
X use above to search/replace <cananian...> with (cananian...)
X write "getCode(String format)" method to HMethod, preload with byte[].
X  -- find out whether interface methods have code attributes.
X     NOPE!
X write "print( )" methods to pretty-print a class file.
X  -- separate ones for raw and HClass?
X     -- HClass should pretty-print in java source form.
X     -- Raw.* should pretty-print the exact class file contents.
Xfigure out whether we are reporting methods of interfaces properly
X  (can we have an abstract interface method that doesn't show up in
X   the declaredMethods?)
X   WE ARE.  YOU CAN'T.
X add Java1.1 attributes (Synthetic and InnerClasses)
X add accessor function for SourceFile attribute
X add accessor function for localvariable attribute.
X create an interface type for all code representations.
X modify getCode to use it.
