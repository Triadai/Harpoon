Provides the classes for coloring generic Graphs.

The purpose of Graph Coloring is to detect potential Interferences
(Resource Conflicts), and then use that knowledge to allow resource
consumers to share resources.  <Q>Graph coloring problems derive from
the old mapmakers' rule that adjacent countries on a map should be
colored with different colors</Q>.  So in this case, colors are the
resource, countries are the consumers, and borders between countries
are the interferences.

<P>
The design of the GraphColoring package implements graph coloring
analysis in terms of four parts: Graphs to represent resource
consumers and the interferences between them, Colors to represent the
resources, ColorFactories to represent resource generators (to allow
for unbounded resources to be represented, like Stack Offsets), and
GraphColorers to assign a mapping from consumers to resources.

<P>
Usually graph coloring is used for Register Allocation problems,
although other problems can often be reduced to graph coloring.
