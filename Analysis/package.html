This package contains analysis routines applicable to a variety of
intermediate representations.  Typically, the only requirement is
that the IR implement some set of properties from 
<code>harpoon.IR.Properties</code>.
<p>
IR-specific analysis should <b>not</b> be placed in this package.
In addition, if you analysis is very complicated, you should also
create a separate package for it.  Primarily basic compiler algorithms
go here, including construction of dominance trees and frontiers
and basic graph algorithms.
