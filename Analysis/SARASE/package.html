This directory contains the Semi-Automatic Rapid Algorithmic Space
Exploration (SARASE) analysis code.  It's a ClassFile to ClassFile 
transformation that generalizes high-level control flow and
parametric search and is particularly useful for scientific application 
development and research.  It was inspired by gene recognition, 
image recognition, speech recognition, early-stage drug discovery and 
radar discrimination problems.

It simultaneously provides higher-level abstractions and 
search granularity and more control and specialization
of search techniques than genetic algorithms - and automatically parallelizes
parametric and algorithmic search for use on SMPs.
