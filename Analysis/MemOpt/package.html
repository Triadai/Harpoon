This package contains an (in)compatibility analysis and a related
memory preallocation optimization.  The full algorithmic details are
presented in our <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~salcianu/publications/popl03_paper.ps">POPL03
paper</a>.

<p>
The incompatibility analysis detects sets of allocation sites with the
property that for each set S, at any given moment during the execution
of the program, at most one object allocated at allocation sites from
S is live.  The preallocation optimization modifies the code for the
allocation sites from a set S of compatible sites such that they reuse
the same statically preallocated piece of memory.
