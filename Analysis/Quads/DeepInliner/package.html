This package contains code that perform inlining.  There are two
classes that contain static methods that perform inlining:

<ul>

<li>{@link OneLevelInliner} - inlines call paths of length 1

<li>{@link DeepInliner} - inlines sets of arbitrary-length call paths.
Each call path is modeled by a {@link InlineChain} object.

</ul>
