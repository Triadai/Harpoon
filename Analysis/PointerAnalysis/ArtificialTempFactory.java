/** 
 * <code>ArtificialTempFactory</code> provides support for the static fields
 in the context of the Pointer Analysis algorithm of Martin & Whaley.
 In that algorith, these fields are modeled by some special class variables
 (CL in the original paper) that point to class nodes that serves as
 containers for the static fields. <br>
 Ex: Suppose we have the classes A and B and that A contains a static field
 called f. Then, to model A.f, we need a variable vA pointing to a special
 <i>class</i> node nC_A which contains the field f. Note that no class 
 variable and no class node are generated for the class B which doesn't have
 any static field.<br>
 Another alternative would be to have a special variable cl.f for each 
 static field cl.f but this would lead to some irregularities in the
 algorithm and will generate a bigger number of <i>artificial</i> nodes.
