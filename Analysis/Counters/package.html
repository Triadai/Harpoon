This package defines a facility for simple counters which can easily
be spliced into a quad-form code for instrumentation purposes and
enabled/disabled individually or in groups by properties on the
command-line.  Basically, a single line to increment the counter
is all you need: no complicated declaration or reporting code is
needed -- although you should make sure that the
<code>HCodeFactory</code> defined by 
<code>harpoon.Analysis.Counters.CounterFactory.codeFactory()</code>
is somewhere
in your compilation path if you want the numbers collected to
be reported when the program finishes.
