\caption{Performance (in cycles per node push on a simple queue

It is worth considering if a low-level HTM can yield benefits other
than efficient implementations of large-object operations.  In fact,
\figref{hybrid} presents research showing that we can combine the
strengths of our object-based software transaction system with a
fast bounded-size HTM.  In the figure, combining the systems is done
in the most simple-minded way: all transactions are begun in
LTM~\cite{AnanianAsKuLeLi04},
and after any abort the transaction is restarted in the
object-based software system.  The field flag mechanism described in
\secref{flagfield} ensures that software transactions properly abort
conflicting hardware transactions; hardware transactions must perform
the \texttt{ReadNT} and \texttt{WriteNT} algorithms for a slight
overhead (as shown in the figure).
