Type ./build to build the main executable...  This is the filesystem 
example.  Read file.cc for the options.  The spec files for this example 
are: 
testmodel teststruct testabstract testconcrete testspace

Contact me to run the ole example - you need to compile the repair tool as a 
library to link into it (or just hack a makefile to do this)

The game example isn't included yet, its pretty big, and I'm not certain of 
licensing issues.
