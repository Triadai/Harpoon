This directory contains (mostly) C source files for the FLEX runtime.

See the file REQUIRED for the tools required to build it.
After installing the tools, you'll want to run ./setup
to let autoheader/autoconf/automake do their thing.
See the INSTALL file for generic build instructions;
the BUILDING file has more specific information.


FILES & DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

AUTHORS
BUILDING
COPYING
README
REQUIRED

  Standard files with very explanatory names.
  

INSTALL

  Standard installation-help file for GNU projects.  Not specific to
  the Flex Runtime.  Consult the BUILDING file instead.


PROFILING

  Info on profiling applications compiled with Flex.


setup

  Setup script you should run immediately after checking out the
  Runtime.  It invokes GNU automake, followed by GNU autoconf to produce
  (1) Makefile.in (a generic Makefile), and (2) configure, a script
  that will configure Makefile.in into the real Makefile, function of
  the architecture/OS details and the user-selected configuration
  options.


Makefile.am

  Input file used by GNU automake to generate Makefile.in.


configure.in

  Input file used by GNU autoconf to generate the "configure" script.
  configure takes Makefile.in as input and produces a configured,
  (hopefully) ready-to-use Makefile.


JarRules.make
JavaRules.make

  Additional make rules for building jars and compiling java
  applications.


arch/

  Architecture-dependent source code.  Inside it, one subdir for each
  relevant architecture (e.g., "arch/ix86/").


src/

  Architecture-independent source code.


Contrib/

  External code we use in the Flex Runtime.  Currently, the only
  component is the BDW GC in Contrib/gc.


scripts/

  Various scripts: flexrun-config.in gen-link-script hacked-java-make
  query-size.sh.
