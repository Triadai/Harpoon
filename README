This is the Realtime Java implementation for FLEX.

What is implemented of the specification fairly accurately conforms to the specification,
with the exception that the numbers returned for the number of bytes left in each MemoryArea,
though completely consistent, are rather bogus.  Also, I didn't worry about the performance
guarantees for CTMemory, since the numbers for bytes left are not accurate anyway.

The Java Realtime specification can be found in:
http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr001/rtj.pdf

In any case, the scoping access restrictions part of the implementation should accurately
reflect the specification.
