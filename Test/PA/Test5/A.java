/**
 * This is a test for the PA algorithm. It reveals a hidden
 problem in the original algorithm: the inclusion of the callee graph
 into the new graph was too restrictive and could even lose relevant
 info. The algorithm has been modified to be more conservative: the entire
 callee's graph is now included into the graph of the caller and later,
 after the recomputation of the escape info, the empty load nodes (the load
 nodes that don't escape anywhere and hence, don't abstract any object)
 and the fake outside edges (outside edges originating in a non-escaping
 node) are removed, together with all the related info.

 <code>A.foo</code> is the interesting method.
