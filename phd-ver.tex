\section{Verification}
My initial work on both software and hardware transaction systems has
reiterated the difficulty of creating correct implementations of
concurrent and fault-tolerant constructs.  Automatic model checking is
a requirement to achieve confidence in the design and implementation.
Versions of the software transaction system have been modelled in
Promela using Spin 4.1.0 and verified on an SGI 64-processor MIPS
machine with 16G of main memory; detecting an correcting a number of
subtle race-conditions in the process.  

Appendix \ref{sec:hw-proof}
presents a model of
the proposed hardware transaction system as well in order to gain more
confidence in its correct specification.
