%% This is the abstract of my thesis.

Transactions are gaining ground as a programmer-friendly means of
expressing concurrency.  This thesis presents efficient
implementations of transactions for three platforms: an
object-oriented software-only system, a scalable system using a custom
processor extension, and in a hybrid of the two systems, obtaining the
benefits of both.

The software transaction system implements \textit{strong atomicity},
which ensures that transactions are protected from the influence of
non-transactional code.  Previous software systems use weaker
atomicity guarantees because strong atomicity was presumed to be too
expensive.  In this thesis strong atomicity is obtained with as little
as 15\% slowdown for non-transactional code.  Compiler analyses can
further improve the efficiency of the mechanism, which has been
model-checked with the SPIN verification system.

Software transaction systems with sufficiently low overhead, such as
ours, can be profitably combined with a hardware transaction system to
provide fast execution of short and small transactions, while allowing
fallback to the software system for large or complicated transactions.
We present UTM, a hardware transactional memory system allowing
unbounded virtualizable transactions, which can be combined with our
software transaction system in this manner.
