%% This is the abstract of my thesis.

Transactions map naturally to human intuition of atomic action in
concurrent systems, eliminating the necessity of locking discipline.
This thesis presents efficient implementations of transactions for
three platforms: an object-oriented software-only system, a scalable
system using a custom processor extension, and in a hybrid of the two
systems, obtaining the benefits of both.  I also present formal models
of the implementation which have been mechanically checked for correct
behavior.

I also explore the implications of available, efficient, and usable
transactions on high-level language design, presenting solutions for
transaction nesting, merging, and loophole mechanisms.  This presents
a solution to the vexing ``I/O'' and modularity problems with
existing transactional mechanisms.  I also present compiler analyses
and type systems to further improve the efficiency, safety, and
usability of our transaction mechanisms.
