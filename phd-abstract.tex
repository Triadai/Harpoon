%% This is the abstract of my thesis.

Transactions are coming into vogue as a flexible synchronization
primitive which maps naturally to human intuition about the desired
behavior of concurrent systems.  This thesis presents efficient
implementations of transactions in an object-oriented
software-only system, in scalable hardware systems, and in a hybrid
of the two systems, obtaining the benefits of both.  I also present
formal models of the implementation which have been mechanically
checked for correct behavior.

I also explore the implications on available, efficient, and usable
transactions on high-level language design, presenting solutions for
transaction nesting, merging, and loop-hole mechanisms.  This presents
a solution to the vexing ``I/O'' and modularity problems with
existing transactional mechanisms.  I also present compiler analyses
and type systems to further improve the efficiency, safety, and
usability of our transaction mechanisms.
