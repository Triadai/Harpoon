<BODY>
This package contains the various analyses needed
for the backend.  These are not generic optimizations; they are specific
information directly needed by the back end.  Examples would include
class/interface numbering, code reordering for cache locality, certain
escape analyses, etc.
<p>
All analyses that don't easily fit into a single class should have their
own subpackage under harpoon.Backend.Analysis.
