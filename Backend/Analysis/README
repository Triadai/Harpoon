The harpoon.Backend.Analysis package is for the various analyses needed
for the backend.  These are not generic optimizations; they are specific
information directly needed by the back end.  Examples would include
class/interface numbering, code reordering for cache locality, certain
escape analyses, etc.

All analyses that don't easily fit into a single class should have their
own subpackage under harpoon.Backend.Analysis.
