The harpoon.Backend.StrongARM package contains machine-dependent classes
for the StrongARM backend. (Frame/CodeGen)

Useful notes:

StrongARM NATIVECALL Caller Convention (As Seen In (tm): gcc arm32-netbsd):
	full, descending stack
	pass parameters 1, 2, 3, 4 in r0, r1, r2, r3 respectively
	after that, push arguments onto the stack (last argument first)
	return value in r0

	r11 = fp, r12 = ip, r13 = sp, r14 = lr, r15 = pc
	callee saves r4-r10
	live on exit: fp, sp, pc

For normal CALLs:
	use same, except that r1 is used for retex (at least as long
	as we're still explicitly returning exceptional values)
