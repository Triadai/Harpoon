The harpoon.Backend.StrongARM package contains machine-dependent classes
for the StrongARM backend. (Frame/CodeGen)

Currently contains basic infrastructure for StrongARM code elements,
more coming once the classes compile, as well as code generation itself.

This is currently based off of the same HCode, etc. superclasses that
Quads use. In the near future it will be modified to use the 
harpoon.IR.Assem.* superclasses.
