/**
 * An <code>InlineMap</code> maps an <code>HField</code> to a boolean value 
 * indicated whether the <code>HField</code> can be inlined.
 * We leave the policy decision of whether it is wise to do so to other
 * code, which will also be an InlineMap.  So, the idea is that a core
 * InlineMap implements the conservative analysis of inline-safety, then
 * a second inline map takes the first inline map and twiddles the inlining
 * results according to whether or not it thinks inlining is really a good
 * idea, using some heuristic.  Or you can leave out the second inline map
 * and its heuristics, which just means you'd like to inline wherever
 * possible.  Have I confused everyone yet?
