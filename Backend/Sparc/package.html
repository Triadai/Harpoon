Provides the classes for generating assembly code targetting the
SPARC platform.

<P>
The main parts of the SPARC backend are the classses
<code>RegFileInfo</code>, <code>InstrBuilder</code>,
<code>Frame</code>, and the spec-file <code>CodeGen.spec</code>.  Also
of note is the <code>TwoWordTemp</code>, which is a extension of the
standard <code>Temp</code> that represents a value that is spread
across two words (which is needed for double and long variables on the
SPARC). 

<P>
Much off this is derived from the StrongARM Backend (with many kudos
to Scott and Felix).
