Be consistent on "I" vs. "We".

Don't go into 3 levels of hierarchy.  Two levels of hierarchy is
almost too much. Three is definitely too much.  Consider Chapter 2:
  intro par
  2.1 four old things
    Don't number the four old things as 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and so forth.
  2.2 four new things
  2.3 some (other) things
(and page 31 talks about what will occur in Section
4.4.4.  Bleah)
I would try to get it down to no numbering within the chapter.  I
would be happy if it went to only subsection numbers.  Use writing to
do the rest of the organization.

Come up with a better word than "things".  Something like "challenges"
would be better.

Chapter 3's title "Designing a Software Transaction System" makes no
sense to me.  What about this chapter is about designing a system.
This chapter is a mix of some measurements and some design choices.

Chapter 4: "Implementing" ?  This title also makes no sense to me.
This chapter i about a Java implementation.  Does it have a name?

Chapter 5:  Topic paragraph needs work.  What is Chapter 5 about?

Chapter 9:  I would flush it, and put all the content into the
introduction.

I think it would be advantageous to Make the code examples be
single-spaced (especially in the appendix).  Also what are all those
#ifdef's doing in the code.  Can you simplify the presentation by
getting rid of unused cases?
