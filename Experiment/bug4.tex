This buggy program is composed of the files {\it file4.cc} and 
{\it file.h}. If you are using the tool, you shouldn't worry about the 
other files.

\vspace{0.1in}
To compile the program, simply type ``./build'' on the command line.\\
To run the program, simply type ``./file4'' on the command line.


\vspace{0.1in}
Initially, the program prints:

\begin{verbatim}
=== BEGIN of link2 ===

=== END of link2 ===
\end{verbatim}

although it should have printed:
\begin{verbatim}
=== BEGIN of link2 ===
TWO
=== END of link2 ===
\end{verbatim}

You are asked to localize and fix the bug that causes this abnormal behavior.
