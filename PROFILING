To profile your compiled java application, do something like the
following:

 % cd ~/Harpoon/Runtime
 % make clean
 % make CC="gcc -pg -g"

Compile your (precisec) application like this:
 % cd ~/Harpoon/Code
 % make -C as<foodir> CC="gcc -I${HARPOON_DIR}/Runtime/include -g -O9 -pg"
 % mv as<foodir>/Java.a ~/Harpoon/Runtime/<foodir>-Java.a

NOTE THAT THE -g OPTION ABOVE IS IMPORTANT!

And build the final executable like so (don't forget the -pg at this step!):
 % cd ~/Harpoon/Runtime
 % make CC="gcc -pg -g" run<foodir>

Ta-da!  Now run your executable.  Your will get a gmon.out file in the
current directory when it finishes execution.  (If you don't, the
most likely cause is that you forgot to include -pg in the last linking
step, immediate above.)  Use

 % gprof run<foodir>

to see the profile.
(If your profiling information shows up with no time information, the
most likely cause is that you forgot to build some parts with the -g option.)
