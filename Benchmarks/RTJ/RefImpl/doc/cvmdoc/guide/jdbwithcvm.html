<h2>Summary & Assumptions</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    JDB is a Java Debugger for debugging Java code.  This document describes one method
    of running JDB with CVM on Linux.  In order to run JDB with CVM, CVM must first be
    built with the build time option <code>CVM_JVMDI=true</code>.  For the purpose of
    simplicity, the following discussions assumes that the CVM bundle is install
    in directory <code>/cvm</code>.
    <p>

<h2>Building & Running the JDWP Agent</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    JDB communicates with CVM through the JDWP agent.  The JDWP agent is dynamically
    linked into CVM to interface with the VM through the JVMDI interface.  
    
    <ul>
    <li>On Linux, it comes in the form of <code>libjdwp.so</code>.  
    <li>On VxWorks, it comes in the form of <code>libjdwp.o</code>.
    </ul> 
    
    <p>To build the agent, cd to <code>/cvm/ext/jpda/build/&lt;platform&gt;</code>, 
    and run 'make'. this builds the needed library in <code>/cvm/jdk_build/&lt;platform&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt;</code>,
    where <code>&lt;platform&gt;</code> is 'linux' or 'vxworks', and <code>&lt;arch&gt;</code> 
    is 'i386' or 'PENTIUM'.
    
    <p>
    To run the JDWP agent with CVM on Linux, cd to <code>/cvm/build/linux/bin</code>
    and invoke
    </p>
<pre>
    cvm -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000
        -Dsun.boot.library.path=../../../jdk_build/linux/lib/i386
        -Djava.class.path=<i>your_class_path</i> <i>your_main_class</i>
</pre>
    <p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>-Xdebug</code> tells CVM to run in debugger mode.
        <li><code>-Xrunjdwp</code> tells CVM to load <code>libjdwp.so</code>
            and it expects to find the JDWP agent in this shared library.
        <li><code>:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000</code> is a
            parameter list to be passed to the JDWP agent.
        <li><code>transport=dt_socket</code> means to connect to the JDB
            front-end using a socket implementation.
        <li><code>server=y</code> means that CVM will serve as a debugging
            server.  This means that CVM will start up and wait for a debugger
            front-end to connect to it.  In this specific case, the connection
            will be via a socket on port 8000.

        <a name=PortAddress></a>
        <li><code>address=8000</code> means that CVM will be listening on port
            8000 for a connection from a debugger front-end.  If you're already
            using port 8000 for something else, feel free to pick another unused
            port number.  Just make sure that your debugger front-end tries to
            attach to the same port number (see <a href=#RunningJDB>Running
            JDB</a> below).
        <a name=SetLibPath></a>
        <li><code>-Dsun.boot.library.path=../../../jdk_build/linux/lib/i386</code>
            tells CVM where to find <code>libjdwp.so</code>.  If you're invoking
            CVM from <code>/cvm/build/linux/bin</code>, this path will
            be correct.  You won't have to change it.  If you're invoking CVM from
            some where else, make sure that <code>-Dsun.boot.library.path=</code>
            points to <code>/cvm/jdk_build/linux/lib/i386</code>.
        <a name=SetClassPath></a>
        <li><code>-Djava.class.path=<i>your_class_path</i></code> tells CVM where to
            find your java app.  If your classpath is simply . (as in the current
            directory), you still need to specify it.
        <li><code><i>your_main_class</i></code> is the name of your Java app.
    </ul>

    <p>To run the JDWP agent with CVM on VxWorks, cd to <tt>/cvm/build/vxworks/bin</tt> 
    and invoke
    
<pre>
    runJavaJdp "-Djava.class.path=&lt;your_class_path your_main_class&gt;
</pre>
    
    <p><code>runJavaJdb</code> sets up the -Xdebug, -Xrunjdwp, -Dsun.boot.library.path 
    arguments for you, and appends your classpath and main class before passing it to 
    'runJava'. The default setting for -Xrunjdwp is ':transport=dt_socket, server=y, address=8000' and the default setting for 
    -Dsun.boot.library.path is '../../../jdk_build/vxworks/lib/PENTIUM. 
    If you need to change either of these parameters, edit the file 
    '/cvm/src/vxworks/biin/vxworks_java_md.c' and alter the <code>runJavaJdb()</code> 
    function as necessary. Rebuild your cvm and VxWorks image and update your 
    target.


    
    <p>
    On either platform, CVM should come up and hang.  Don't worry.  That is proper behavior because it is
    now waiting for the debugger front-end to connect before executing any Java byte
    codes.
    <p>

<h2>Running JDB</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    Now that you have CVM up and running (if you don't, see <a href=#BuildingJDWP>
    Building & Running the JDWP Agent for CVM</a>), you can start JDB and have it
    connect to your currently running instance of CVM.  To do this:
    <ol>
        <li>You will need JDK1.3 installed (typically in
            <code>/usr/local/java/jdk1.3/linux/bin</code>).  If JDK1.3 is not
            installed, you can get it at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/">
            http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3</a>. Of course, if your CVM is running on 
            VxWorks, then your jdb will need to be running on a remote host 
            that has JDK1.3 installed.
        <li>In another terminal window (to keep the stdin/out for JDB separate from
            that of CVM), cd to the root directory where your Java source is stored.
            This is needed because JDB will look for the source in the directory
            from which it is invoked.  If you don't do this, JDB will still run,
            but you won't be able to see the source code as you step through your debug
            cycle.
            <br><br>

            Alternatively, you may choose to specify a source path from which JDB
            will load the source file of the classes being debugged.  See the
            <a href=#Sourcepath><code>-sourcepath</code></a> option below for
            information on how to do this.  If you specify a source path, you won't
            have to cd to the root directory of your java source.  JDB will search
            the specified source path fo the Java source files it is expecting.
            <br><br>

            NOTE: It is the debugger front-end (JDB) that needs and sets the
            source path.  The back-end (CVM) does not need the source path.
            However, if the back-end is running code that is not compiled from the
            source code that the front-end is refering to, you might get an erroneous
            correlation between code being executed in the back-end and the source
            you're viewing in the front-end.  So make sure your source (.java file)
            and executable (.class file) being debugged are in sync.
            <br><br>
        <li>Next, invoke
<pre>
    jdb -attach <i>your_server_machine</i>:8000 -sourcepath <i>your_sourcepath</i>
</pre>
            <ul>
                <li><code>jdb</code> is the java debugger that comes in the form of
                    a Java app packaged with the JDK.  If you have
                    <code>/usr/local/java/jdk1.3/linux/bin</code> in your path,
                    you should have no problem invoking it.
                <li><code>-attach <i>your_server_machine</i>:8000</code> tells JDB to
                    connect to port 8000 on the specified server machine.  Be sure to
                    specify the same machine as the one where you are running the CVM
                    back-end.  If you're running on the same machine where
                    CVM is running, you can choose to omit the
                    <code><i>your_server_machine</i>:</code> part.  JDB will look on
                    the local host for the specified port by default if you don't
                    explicitly specify the server.  If you specified a different
                    <a href=#PortAddress>port</a> when you invoked CVM, then make sure
                    to specify the same port number here.
                <a name=Sourcepath></a>
                <li><code>-sourcepath <i>your_sourcepath</i></code> tells JDB where to
                    look for the Java source files that correspond to the java class
                    files being debugged.  The sourcepath is analogous to the Java
                    classpath except that it is for finding the .java files as opposed
                    to the .class files.  The sourcepath is structured as directory
                    paths separated by colons.
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>

    For example, the following illustrates the invocation of JDB on a host machine
    named <code>acorn</code> to connect with a CVM instance running JDWP with the
    HelloWorld class (from the testclasses.zip that comes with CVM) on port 8000
    of a server machine named <code>peanut</code>:
<pre>
    acorn> jdb -attach peanut:8000 -sourcepath /cvm/src/share/javavm/test
</pre>

    <b>Note:</b> To find out about other JDB options, you can invoke <code>jdb -help</code> for a
    list of the supported JDB options.  JDB will come up running (after a slight pause
    to load the JDK VM which it runs on).  You should see the following:
<pre>
    Initializing jdb...

    VM Started: No frames on the current call stack

    main[1] main[1]
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you get here, all is well, you have set up the debugging session correctly.
If not, go back and double check that you have entered everything correctly.
Some possible reasons for JDB not working are:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CVM couldn't find the Java app class because you didn't specify the
            correct classpath (see <a href=#SetClassPath>
            <code>-Djava.class.path=...</code></a>).
        <li>CVM couldn't find <code>libjdwp.so</code> because you didn't specify the
            correct native lib path (see <a href=#SetLibPath>
            <code>-Dsun.boot.library.path=...</code></a>).
        <li>Any other thing that you thought you did right but didn't.  Go back and
            double check.
    </ul>
    <p>


    <b>Note:</b> <code>main[1]</code> is a prompt where you can start entering JDB commands.
    Upon entering JDB for the first time, enter "list" to see a listing of the
    method you're currently in. You'll get a message like this:
<pre>
    main[1] list
    No frames on the current call stack
    main[1]
</pre>

    This is because the VM has not entered any methods yet.  To enter the very first method,
    type <code>step</code> and you will see a message like this:
<pre>
    main[1] step
    main[1]
    Step completed: thread="main", HelloWorld.main(), line=14, bci=0
      14     if (args != null && args.length >= 1 && args[0].equals("-kgh")) {
    main[1]
</pre>

    The source code line displayed is the next line of code you will execute if you
    <code>step</code> the debugger (by typing <code>step</code> at the JDB command
    prompt).<br>
    Now, if you type <code>list</code> at the command prompt, you will see a partial
    listing of the source code like this:
<pre>
    main[1] list
    10
    11         public class HelloWorld {
    12
    13             public static void main(String args[]) {
    14      =>      if (args != null && args.length >= 1 ** args[0].equals("-kgh")) {
    15                  System.out.println("Hullo from the E-spot VM!");
    16              } else {
    17                  System.out.println("Hello World.");
    18              }
    19             }
    main[1] 
</pre>

    You are now ready to try out a few other JDB commands and/or commence with your
    debugging activities.
    <p>

<h2>What's in JDB</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    Now that you have JDB up and running, you can do usual debugger things with it.  For
    example step, list the source, set breakpoints, etc.
    For example:
    <ul>
        <li><code>classes</code><br>
            Lists all classes that have been loaded.  However, note that all ROMIZED
            classes (because they are PRE-LOADED ... keyword being LOADED) will be
            listed whether they are in use or not.
        <li><code>help</code><br>
            Lists the available JDB commands.
        <li><code>list</code><br>
            Lists the current source code.  It also shows where in the code you are
            currently executing.  This only works if you invoked JDB from the root of
            your source directory of if you have specified the appropriate source path.
        <li><code>run</code><br>
            Runs until the next breakpoint is encountered or until the program ends.
        <li><code>step</code><br>
            Executes a single step.
        <li><code>step up</code><br>
            Executes until the VM exits the current method.
        <li><code>quit</code><br>
            Exits JDB.
    </ul>
    <p>

    You can get a complete list of the available commands by typing <code>help</code>
    at the JDB command prompt.
