<font color=blue><h2>Introduction</h2></font>

<p>In CVM, garbage collection may be running at any time during
program execution, searching for program state or changing object
addresses behind your back. Therefore, you should be very careful
whenever you want to access and change Java objects from native
code. 

<p>The <i>indirect memory interface</i> allows you to safely
manipulate objects from native code. The calls that make up the
indirect memory interface operate on pointers to <i>ICells</i>
(indirection cells), which are non-moving locations in memory holding
object references. ICells must be <i>registered</i> with GC, so they
can be found and updated when a GC occurs. Registered ICells may be
<i>local roots</i>, or <i>global roots.</i>

<p>The implementation of the indirect memory interface makes use of a
per-thread <i>GC-safety</i> flag. Each indirect memory call on an
ICell marks the caller thread as <i>GC-unsafe</i>, manipulates the
Java object encapsulated by the ICell, and marks the thread as
<i>GC-safe</i> again. Threads that are marked GC-unsafe cannot
tolerate GC until they are marked GC-safe again. GC is only allowed to
proceed if all threads are GC-safe. Use of the indirect interface in
conjunction with registered ICells makes your C code safe from garbage
collection, and makes the garbage collector aware of your Java object
use.

<p>Please refer to <a href=directmem.html>the direct memory
interface</a> and the <a href=indirectmem.html>the indirect memory
interface</a> for reference.


<a name=icells>
<font color=blue><h2>Living with ICells</h2></font>

<p>ICells and the indirect memory interface form the foundation of the
<i>exactness</i> architecture of CVM. Therefore it is critical to understand
the various ways these calls can be used to ensure GC-safety.

<p>Working on an exact system is different than working on a
conservative system. In a conservative system, the garbage collector
scans the native stacks and native registers, searching for values
that <i>look like</i> pointers. So in order to keep a heap object
<i>alive</i>, it is sufficient to keep around references to it in
registers or stack locations, and GC will find them.

<p>In an exact system, all locations holding pointers to heap objects
must be known to the garbage collector. There are two types of
such known locations:

<ol>
<li> <b>Implicitly registered locations</b>: The garbage collector has
a <i>default root scan</i>, and certain well-known VM data structures
are considered to be default roots. Among this group are class
statics, string intern tables, JNI tables holding global Ref's, and
others. All the references in these data structures are considered
<i>implicitly registered</i> with GC.

<li> <b>Explicitly registered locations</b>: Any ICells that are not
included in the default root scan of GC must be explicitly registered,
either by the local roots mechanism or the global roots mechanism.
</ol>

<A name=typing>
<font color=blue><h3>ICell types</h3></font>

<p>ICells encapsulate direct heap object references. Heap objects may
be regular Java objects or arrays. There are different ICell types to
express each. ICells for all non-array object types are declared as
<tt>CVMObjectICell</tt>. Arrays of different Java types have
corresponding ICell types. For basic type <tt>&lt;T&gt;</tt>, the
right ICell type is <tt>CVMArrayOf&lt;T&gt;ICell</tt>.

<p>Here's the list:
<pre>
    CVMObjectICell         ocell;   /* for CVMObject references         */

    CVMArrayOfByteICell    acellb;  /* for CVMArrayOfByte references    */
    CVMArrayOfShortICell   acells;  /* for CVMArrayOfShort references   */
    CVMArrayOfCharICell    acellc;  /* for CVMArrayOfChar references    */
    CVMArrayOfBooleanICell acellz;  /* for CVMArrayOfBoolean references */
    CVMArrayOfIntICell     acelli;  /* for CVMArrayOfInt references     */
    CVMArrayOfRefICell     acellr;  /* for CVMArrayOfRef references     */
    CVMArrayOfFloatICell   acellf;  /* for CVMArrayOfFloat references   */
    CVMArrayOfLongICell    acelll;  /* for CVMArrayOfLong references    */
    CVMArrayOfDoubleICell  acelld;  /* for CVMArrayOfDouble references  */
</pre>

<p>Since ICells contain references that may be manipulated by GC,
their referents should be set, nulled, and assigned to one another
using calls from the indirect memory interface (see <a
href=indirectmem.html#icell>ICell manipulations</a> from the <a
href=indirectmem.html>indirect memory interface reference</a>). Their
values should only be passed around as <tt>ICell*</tt> to ensure
GC-safety. So given <tt>ocell1</tt> and <tt>ocell2</tt> of type
<tt>CVMObjectICell</tt>:

<pre>
    CVMObjectICell* ocell1;
    CVMObjectICell* ocell2;
    CVMExecEnv*     ee = CVMgetEE();
    CVMBool res;

    <... make sure ocell1 and ocell2 point to registered ICells. They could be
    local roots or global roots, for example. See below ...>

    CVMID_icellSetNull(ee, ocell1);
    CVMID_icellSetNull(ee, ocell2);

    CVMassignDirectReferenceTo(ee, ocell1);
    CVMID_icellIsNull(ee, ocell1, res);
    if (!res) {
        /* Assign the referent of ocell1 to the referent of ocell2 */
        CVMID_icellAssign(ee, ocell2, ocell1); 
    }
</pre>

In the example above, the only values passed around are
<i>pointers</i> to ICells. Any assignment to the encapsulated direct
object reference of an ICell (as <tt>assignDirectReferenceTo()</tt>
does) must happen in a <i>GC-unsafe</i> region, created in the body of
the implementation of <tt>CVMID_icellAssign()</tt>. GC-unsafe regions
are to be explained in the section on <a href=#threads>GC-safety of
threads</a>.

<a name=roots>
<font color=blue><h3>Explicitly Registered Roots</h3></font>

Heap object references that are not part of the default root scan of
garbage collection need to be explicitly registered with the
collector. There are two separate mechanisms for explicit
registration:

<ol>
<li><b>Local roots:</b> These are short-lived values, like local
variables. They are allocated and deallocated in a stack-like
fashion. The interface for using them is geared towards fast
allocation and deallocation, and does not allow out-of-order
deallocation.

<li><b>Global roots:</b> These are long-lived values, like global
variables. The program can obtain registered global root locations
through the global roots API. Global roots may be created and
destroyed out-of-order.
</ol>

<a name=localroots>
<font color=blue><h3>Declaring and Using Local Roots</h3></font>

<p> Local roots are an efficient way of declaring, registering and
unregistering ICells of local scope. They are typically used to hold
relatively short-lived values; think of them as GC-registered local
variables. Also note that local roots are thread-local; they are
created, used and discarded in the same thread.

<p> The use pattern is the following:
<pre>
    //
    // Start a local root block, passing in the current 'ee'
    // (execution environment), which contains per-thread information.
    //
    CVMID_localrootBegin(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>); {
        CVMID_localrootDeclare(Type1ICell, var1);
        CVMID_localrootDeclare(Type2ICell, var2);
	//
        // use var1 and var2 as Type1ICell* and Type2ICell*
        // respectively
	//
        // do NOT leave the block without executing
        // CVMID_localrootEnd()!
	//	
    } CVMID_localrootEnd();
</pre>    

<p>Since local roots occur more often (dynamically) than global roots,
the interface for using local roots is optimized for allowing
stack-like fast allocation and deallocation. Conceptually:

<ol>
<li> <tt>CVMID_localrootBegin()</tt> marks the beginning of a scope
containing a list of <tt>CVMID_localrootDeclare()</tt> calls.

<li> The implementation keeps track of <tt>CVMID_localrootDeclare()</tt>
calls. For each, it allocates and registers a local ICell and declares
an <tt>ICell</tt> pointer to that registered ICell.

<li> When the programmer is done with the local roots in the scope,
he/she calls <tt>CVMID_localrootEnd()</tt>, which discards all allocated
local roots in that scope.
</ol>

<p>Note that it is important to call <tt>CVMID_localrootEnd()</tt> when
leaving a local root scope; this call discards all registered local
roots declared since the last <tt>CVMID_localrootBegin()</tt>. Also note
that <tt>CVMID_localrootBegin()</tt> and <tt>CVMID_localrootEnd()</tt> may
nest arbitrarily.

<p>Here is a good example to illustrate local root use:

<blockquote>
<h4>Example:</h4> 

<p>You want to call an allocating operation that is possibly a few
functions deep. Therefore you want the caller to declare a local root,
and pass its corresponding <tt>ICell*</tt> as a result argument to the
operation. This keeps the allocated object safe from garbage
collection the moment it is stored in the result argument. When the
operation is complete, the caller can unregister the local root.

<p>The following creates a Java string from a Utf8 string. It is an
inlined (fast) version of the String constructor. It uses two local
roots for temporary values, and discards them after a String has been
successfully created and assigned to a <tt>result</tt> ICell.

<pre>
void CVMmakeStringFromUtf8(CVMUtf8* chars, CVMObjectICell* result) {
    CVMID_localrootBegin(); {
	// Two local roots to be used as temporaries
	CVMID_localRootDeclare(CVMObjectICell,      string);
	CVMID_localRootDeclare(CVMArrayOfCharICell, theChars);

	CVMJavaInt length;

	// Make the string object
	CVMID_objectNewInstance   (CVMjavaLangStringClassblock, string);

	// .. . and the chars array
	// Pass the local root in to receive the resulting char[]
	CVMmkArrayOfCharFromUtf8  (chars, theChars);
	
	CVMID_arrayGetLength      (theChars, length);

	//
	// Assign the values of the string
        //
	CVMID_fieldWriteRef(string,
	                    CVM_offsetOf_java_lang_String_value,  
	                    theChars);

	CVMID_fieldWriteInt(string, 
	                    CVM_offsetOf_java_lang_String_length, 
	                    length);

	CVMID_fieldWriteInt(string, 
	                    CVM_offsetOf_java_lang_String_offset, 
	                    0);

	// We write the result back to the result ICell. 
	CVMID_icellAssign  (result, string);

	// We can now discard the local roots, assuming 'result' was
	// a pointer to a registered ICell.
    } CVMID_localrootEnd();
</pre>

A possible caller of this may be the constant resolution code,
resolving a constant pool entry of type <tt>CONSTANT_String</tt>. The
result ICell may be the actual constant pool slot, which is updatable
by GC when it scans class information. (In other words, the constant
pool slot for a String constant is an implicitly registered ICell).

<p>So the call would be something like:

<pre>
    void CVMresolveStringConstant(CVMConstantPool* cp,
                                  CVMJavaShort strIdx,
			          CVMJavaShort utf8Idx)
    {
        CVM_CLASS_RESOLUTION_LOCK();
            CVMID_icellSetNull(&cp.entries[strIdx].str);
            //
            // Mark it as being resolved. This way, no thread can
            // yet use this c.p. entry; however GC can scan it
            // if necessary.
            //
            CVMcpSetBeingResolved(cp, strIdx);
            CVMmakeStringFromUtf8(cp.entries[utf8Idx],
	                          &cp.entries[strIdx].str);
            CVMcpSetResolved(cp, strIdx);
        CVM_CLASS_RESOLUTION_UNLOCK();
    }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name=globalroots>
<font color=blue><h3>Declaring and Using Global Roots</h3></font>

<p> Global root registration allows for declaring, registering and
unregistering ICells of global scope. Global roots are typically used
to hold long-lived values that are to be included in the GC root scan;
think of them as GC-registered global variables.

<p> The use pattern is the following:
<pre>
    //
    // Part of CVMglobals
    //
    struct CVMGlobalState {
        ....
        CVMObjectICell*      globalRoot1;
        CVMObjectICell*      globalRoot2;
	....
    }
    ...
    void CVMinitThisModule()
    {
        CVMglobals.globalRoot1 = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();
	CVMglobals.globalRoot2 = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();
	...
    }
    ...
    void CVMuseThisModule()
    {
	// globalRoot1 and globalRoot2 may safely be used as
	// ICell* arguments to CVMID_ operations.
	CVMID_objectNewInstance(CVMclassJavaLangStringClassblock,
	                        CVMglobals.globalRoot2);
	CVMID_icellAssign(CVMglobals.globalRoot1, CVMglobals.globalRoot2);
    }
    ...
    void CVMexitThisModule()
    {
        CVMID_freeGlobalRoot(CVMglobals.globalRoot1);
        CVMID_freeGlobalRoot(CVMglobals.globalRoot2);
    }
</pre>    

Any long-lived ICell declaration should be registered as a global
root. These include C structure fields and global variables.

<p>Here are some examples:
<blockquote>
<h4>Example 1:</h4> 
<p>Registering an ICell referred to by a C struct. There
may be long-lived C structures in the system with heap object
references, like a C hash table with a Java array as the list of
values. Such a table existed in JavaOS. The declaration for that hash
table in CVM would be:
<pre>
typedef struct CVMStrIDhash {
    < ... Other hashtable fields ...>
    CVMArrayOfRefICell* params;	/* param table, if needed */
} CVMStrIDhash;
</pre>
where the <tt>params</tt> array is declared as an ICell* holding an
array of references. We would allocate these <tt>StrIDhash</tt> nodes
as follows:
<pre>
/* Create a hash table of the specified size */
static CVMStrIDhash *
CVMcreateHash(int sizeInBytes)
{
    CVMStrIDhash *h;
    h = (StrIDhash *)CVMCcalloc(1, sizeInBytes); 
    if (h != NULL) { 
        CVMinitNode(h);
	//
	// Register and null out the value
	//
	h->params = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();
    }
    return h;
}
</pre>
After registration, <tt>h->params</tt> may be used as a registered
<tt>ICell*</tt> parameter to other <tt>CVMID_</tt> operations. So to
allocate the <tt>params</tt> array:
<pre>
CVMBool
CVMmkParams(CVMStrIDhash* hash, int size)
{
    CVMArrayOfRefICell* params = hash->params;
    CVMID_newArrayOfRef(CVMjavaLangObjectClassblock, size, params);
    if (CVMID_icellIsNull(params)) {
        return CVM_FALSE; // Allocation failed
    } else {
        return CVM_TRUE;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Example 2:</h4> Here is another example of a C structure that
contains a Java pointer. This declaration is from the
<tt>CVMClassblock</tt> structure. Whenever a new
<tt>CVMClassblock</tt> is allocated, the <tt>ICell*</tt> typed fields
are initialized to point to fresh global roots:

<pre>
    struct CVMClassblock {
        ...
        CVMObjectICell* classLoader;
        ...
    };
    typedef struct CVMClassblock CVMClassblock;

    ...
    CVMClassblock*  class    = (CVMClassblock*)CVMCcalloc(1, sizeof(CVMClassblock));

    //
    // Get a new, nulled global root to hold a classloader reference
    //
    class->classLoader       = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();

    //
    // Make a new ClassLoader instance, and assign it to its location
    // in class 'class'.
    //
    CVMID_objectNewInstance(CVMglobals.javaLangClassLoaderClassblock, class->classLoader);
</pre>

<p>When the <tt>CVMClassblock</tt> is freed, all its registered global
roots must be freed first:

<pre>
void CVMclassUnload(CVMClassblock* class)
{
    //
    // Free all class-related data structures
    //  
    ...
    //
    // Now get rid of the global roots
    //
    CVMID_freeGlobalRoot(class->classLoader);

    // And finally the Classblock itself
    CVMCfree(class);
}
</pre>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Example 3:</h4> Registering well-known values. Let's assume that
we want to have global instances of the <tt>java.lang.Class</tt>
versions of some Java classes. Note that CVM would not necessarily do
this, since <tt>Classblock</tt>s are not allocated on the heap, but it
is a good example for global roots.
<pre>
    //
    // Part of CVMglobals
    //
    struct CVMGlobalState {
        ....
        CVMObjectICell* classJavaLangObject;
        CVMObjectICell* classJavaLangString;
	....
    }
    ...
    CVMinitVM()
    {
        /* Allocate and null out global roots */
        CVMglobals.classJavaLangObject = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();
        CVMglobals.classJavaLangString = CVMID_getGlobalRoot();

	// ... and they lived happily ever after
	CVMfindSystemClass("java/lang/Object", CVMglobals.classJavaLangObject);
	CVMfindSystemClass("java/lang/String", CVMglobals.classJavaLangString);
    }
</pre>

<a name=threads>
<font color=blue><h2>GC-safety of threads</h2></font>

<p>Each thread in CVM has a flag called the <i>GC-safety
flag</i>. Whenever a thread performs an operation that manipulates
heap objects directly, it is marked as GC-unsafe. If another thread
initiates a GC at this time, all threads must be rolled to GC-safe
points in order for GC to proceed safely.

<p>The byte-code interpreter typically works in a GC-unsafe manner to
allow for efficient direct access to heap objects. To bound the time
the thread remains GC-unsafe, backwards branches, method calls, and
method returns are designated as GC-safe points. At those points each
thread polls for GC. If there is a GC request, the thread suspends itself to
rendezvous with all the other threads rolling forward to their GC
points. Execution continues after GC.

<p>The implementation of the indirect memory interface marks the caller
thread GC-unsafe while it is manipulating object references
directly. These are typically very simple operations, and result in
only a small window of GC-unsafety.

<p>CVM also allows arbitrary sets of operations to proceed in GC-unsafe
regions. These operations should be bounded in execution time, and are
not allowed to block.

<p>To see the full set of GC-safety operations, see <a
href=directmem.html#threads>GC-safety of threads</a> from the <a
href=directmem.html>direct memory interface reference</a>.

<a name=gcatomic>
<font color=blue><h3>GC-atomic blocks</h3></font>

<p>If you want GC disallowed while executing a certain set of
operations, use:

<p>
<pre>
    CVMD_gc<font color=#CC0000>U</font>nsafeExec(ee,
	<... gc-unsafe code ...>
    )
</pre>

where <tt>ee</tt> is a pointer to the execution environment
(<tt>CVMExecEnv</tt>) of the current thread.

<p>The GC-unsafe code may not block, perform I/O, or otherwise take
too long to execute, in order to keep the time GC is diabled to a minimum.

<p>When writing GC-unsafe code, extreme care must be taken to avoid
calls to arbitrary library routines. These may take too long to
execute, or grab platform locks that might end up blocking. The example of
<tt>malloc()</tt> comes to mind. So make sure you become GC-safe
before making such a call (see <a href=#gcoffer>Offering a GC-safe
point</a> below).

<p>Direct pointers to objects may be used within the unsafe block;
however, you should make sure that all direct values are written back
into registered ICells before exiting the <tt>gcunsafe</tt> block.

<p>Use this model rarely and with great care. In some cases, if you
really feel it must be used, then maybe it is because it would be
useful to add new functions to the CVMID_ interface. Then we might choose
to do that, and avoid CVMD_gcUnsafeExec().

<blockquote>
<h4>Example 1:</h4>
<p>Let's say that you want to use two direct memory accesses
consecutively without the overhead of being GC-unsafe around
each. Here's how you would do that:

<p>
<pre>
CVMObjectICell* cell1;
CVMObjectICell* cell2;
CVMJavaInt      val1, val2;

...
&lt; Assume cell1 and cell2 point to registered ICells &gt;
...
CVMD_gcUnsafeExec(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>, {
    CVMObject* o1 = CVMID_icellDirect(cell1);
    CVMObject* o2 = CVMID_icellDirect(cell2);

    // Read the third integer field of
    // each object.
    CVMD_fieldReadInt(o1, 2, val1);
    CVMD_fieldReadInt(o2, 2, val2);
} ); // End of gcunsafe region
</pre>        
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Example 2:</h4> 

<p>Setting the referent of an ICell. The example below takes an ICell*
for a <tt>char[]</tt> array, allocates a string, starts a GC-unsafe
region, and calls out to initialize the string's fields. The ICell
pointed to by <tt>resultString</tt> gets a reference to the allocated
string before the GC-unsafe region is exited.

<p>Note that this sort of long GC-unsafe region is intended as an
example only; this style should only be used in performance critical
points, where direct accesses help make the code faster.

<pre>
void CVMmakeString(CVMArrayOfCharICell* theChars,
                   CVMObjectICell* resultString) {
    CVMID_localrootBegin(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>); {
        CVMID_localrootDeclare(CVMObjectICell, tempString);
        // Allocate a String
	CVMID_objectNewInstance(CVMjavaLangStringClassblock, tempString);

        CVMD_gcUnsafeExec(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>, {
	    CVMObject*      str   = CVMID_icellDirect(tempString);
	    CVMArrayOfChar* chars = CVMID_icellDirect(theChars);
	    CVMJavaInt      a_len;  

	    CVMD_arrayGetLength(chars, a_len);

	    // Set the referent of the ICell that resultString points to
	    CVMID_icellSetDirect(resultString, str);
	} );
    } CVMID_localrootEnd();
}

<blockquote>
<h4>Example 3:</h4>

<p>Performing an operation that modifies a data structure that is a
default GC root. In the example below <tt>CVMicellList[]</tt> is a
thread-local list of free ICells, and is a default GC
root. <tt>CVMgetICell()</tt> allocates ICells from the list. All assigned
ICells from the list are scanned by GC during the root scan. The
operation needs to disable GC; otherwise a GC scan might find the
ICell list in an inconsistent state.

<pre>
CVMObjectICell CVMicellList[];
CVMUint32      CVMicellListPtr;

<font color=blue><h3>Offering a GC-safe point</h3></font>

Code that is GC-unsafe for long segments must periodically
<i>offer</i> a GC-safe point. For example, the interpreter runs in a
GC-unsafe way, manipulating direct pointers, etc., but at backwards
branches, at method calls, and maybe other points, it must offer to be
GC-safe to bound the time from a GC request to a GC cycle start. Also,
long running operations like data structure expansions or lengthy
computations must offer to be GC-safe occasionally. And finally, the
VM must offer GC-safe points before doing potentially blocking OS
calls like dynamic linker resolution for natives, acquiring locks, or
I/O in order to make sure there are no blocked, GC-unsafe threads in
the system.

<p>The standard pattern of doing this is to use the
<tt>CVMD_gcSafeExec()</tt> or the
<tt><font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeCheckPoint</font>()</tt>
macros. For details, refer to <a href=directmem.html#threads>GC-safety
of threads</a> from the <a href=directmem.html>direct memory interface
reference</a>.

<p><tt><font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeCheckPoint</font>()</tt> is used
to offer a GC-safe point for operations that will definitely not block:
<pre>
    <font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeCheckPoint</font>(
        ee,
        {
            &lt;Save your state for possible GC&gt;
        },
        {
            &lt;Restore your state after possible GC&gt;
        }
    );
</pre>

<p><tt><font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeExec</font>()</tt> is used to offer
a GC-safe point for operations that might block<font color=#CC0000>:</font>
<font color=#CC0000><s>
Here, the state saving operation and
the potentially blocking operation are separated:
</s></font>
<pre>
    <font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeExec</font>(
        ee,
        <font color=#CC0000><s>{
            &lt;Save your state for possible GC&gt;
        },</s></font>
        {
            &lt;Do potentially blocking operation&gt;
	}<font color=#CC0000><s>,
        {
            &lt;Restore your state after possible GC&gt;
        }</s></font>
    );
</pre>

<font color=#CC0000><s>
<p> Note that in the case of <tt>CVMD_gcSafeExecMayBlock(),</tt> the state
saving and restoration are executed unconditionally. They are included
in the definition of <tt>CVMD_gcSafeExecMayBlock()</tt> to associate the
state saving and restoration operations with ensuring the GC-safety of
the blocking operation.
</s></font>

<p>At the end of one of these macros, the executing thread is once
again GC-unsafe.

<h4>Example 1:</h4> 

<p>The interpreter becomes GC-safe on a backwards branch.
<p><pre>
    <...>
    case opc_goto: {
        CVMJavaShort skip = CVMgetJavaShort(currentPc + 1);
        if (skip <= 0) {
	    <font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeCheckPoint</font>(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>,
                {
		    CVM_DECACHE_INTERPRETER_STATE(currentFrame,
					          currentPc, 
					          currentSp);
		},
                {
                    // No reconstruction needed since Java code
		    // will not execute in this thread
		    // between DECACHE_... and GC.
                }
	    );
        }
        CVMexecuteNextInstructionAtOffset(skip);
    }
    <...>
</pre>        

In effect, the <tt><font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeCheckPoint</font>()</tt>
operation polls a global
variable to see if a GC is requested. If it is requested, then the
state save operation occurs, GC is run, and the state is
reconstructed. If no GC was requested, we go on. This is a very cheap
way to create polling-based GC-safe points.

<h4>Example 2:</h4> 

<p>Blocking operations need to become GC-safe. Here's a tricky
example: a two-part <tt>monitorenter</tt> operation. The first one
gets access to the object, and checks to see if blocking is needed. If
no blocking needed, there is no need to become GC-safe. If blocking is
needed, we save our state, become GC-safe and block.

<h4>Example 3:</h4> 

VM becomes GC-safe before making a call that might allocate from the C
heap. This routine may end up taking a long time execute, or even
worse, block on an OS lock. Therefore the VM needs to become GC-safe
before making the call, in a way that allows blocking.

<p>Here's an excerpt from the stack expansion code that becomes
GC-safe before attempting to allocate from the C heap.

<pre>
    CVMStackVal32*
    CVMexpandStack(CVMStack* obj, CVMUint32 capacity)
    {
        ....
	 * Must allocate new chunk. Take excess capacity into account.
	 */
	size = sizeof(CVMStackChunk) + 
	    sizeof(CVMStackVal32) * (capacity - CVM_MIN_STACKCHUNK_SIZE);

	newStackSize = s->stackSize + capacity;
	if (newStackSize > CVM_MAX_STACK_SIZE) {
	   ... throw exception ...
	}
	<font color=#CC0000>CVMD_gcSafeExec</font>(<font color=#CC0000>ee</font>,

    }
</pre>

<!--
Note that a similar set of operations may be needed for allocation. If
an object allocation doesn't potentially block (say by acquiring a
lock), it might not need to cause an interpreter state save
operation. If a GC is requested, however, we have to save our
state. This requires a tryAllocationNoGC() set of functions,
and a tryAllocationAfterGC() set of functions. The first one
requires no state change; the second one does.
