In order to build jTools you will need the following software packages:

   - ANT
   - GCC
   - GCJ
   - Any Java 2 compatible Java JDK.
   - Python

Note: Currently the only platform supported is Linux, Windows support
      will be coming soon.

Once you have properly installed the software packages listed above,
to build jTools you have simply to do the following:

$ tar xzvf jTools.tar.gz
$ cd jTools
$ ant

To make the demos do the following:

$ ant demo

Once you have compiled jTools, you will have to set the following
environment variables, assuming that JTOOLS_HOME represent the path
from where you invoked ANT in the building phase outlined above, then
add the following lines into your .bashrc (or equivalent):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JTOOLS_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export CLASSPATH=$JTOOLS_HOME/lib/jtools.jar
