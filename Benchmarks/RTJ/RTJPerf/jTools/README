  jTools is a collection of classes that are commonly used by Java applications.
Currently the things provided by jTools include:

          - jArgo: Argument parsing and validation

          - High Resolution Time/Clock: Classes that provide high
            resolution time measurement, in a platform specific way. On
            Pentium processors the RDTSC register is used.

          - Basic Assertions support


All the sources are under the "src" directory, while the directory
"demo" contains some code sample that show how to use the feature
provided by jTools. The API is under "doc/api".
