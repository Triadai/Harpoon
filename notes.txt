Note that LL/SC only work for word-size data.  Double-word writes must be
done as two word writes (which is consistent with the Java language
spec's atomicity language).  Sub-word writes, however, must be done as
follows:
   x = LL(header byte)
   if (x!=NULL) bail();
   v = load(location)
   update subrange of v <-- instruction in PPC arch for this
   if (!SC(location, v)) loop.

This ensures that transactional -vs- non-transactional writes are safe
(due to the lock on the header byte), but racing non-transactional
writes to adjacent bytes or shorts can result in corruption.
