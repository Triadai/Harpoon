An interpreter for tree form.  Uses Java's built-in garbage collection
and run-time to serve as the run-time for the interpreted code.
Outputs profiling information and statistics if you ask nicely.
Currently handles only canonical tree form.  It is unclear to me that there
is any benefit to supporting an interpreter for tree with ESEQ, but if 
there is enough demand, perhaps I will get around to it. 

The interpreter is similar to the quad interpreter.  The main differences 
are:

<UL>
  <LI>The <code>Pointer</code> classes, to handle Tree form's pointers.
  <LI>The <code>TreeInterpreter</code> class, which is found in 
      <code>Method.java</code>.  This class is the heart of the interpreter.
  <LI>The class loading mechanisms found in the <code>StaticState</code> 
      class.
</UL>

The similarities of the interpreters may warrant eventually unifying them
under a set of common superclasses.
