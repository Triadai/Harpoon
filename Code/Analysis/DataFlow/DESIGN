Data flow equation solver

This is really easy to use.  It takes something with a graph
structure, and iterates over it, applying transfer functions to the
nodes, until it reaches a fixed point.

It can iterate over the nodes in two ways: reverse-post-order or
worklist.  Which is faster will depend on your application.  In
general, the reverse-post-order has lower iteration overhead, but
evaluates more transfer functions than the worklist.  So, if you have
fast transfer functions, use reverse-post-order, otherwise use
worklist.

What to watch out for:
- Make sure that your transfer functions will be monotonic, so that
the solver will eventually terminate.
