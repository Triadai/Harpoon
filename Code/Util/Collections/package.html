Provides the classes for working with and generating Collections of
and Graphs of Objects. 

The purpose of the <code>harpoon.Util.Collections</code> package is to collect
together all of our Collections-related classes. 

One key portion of the Collections package are the various Collection
factories, which are designed to allow code to parameterize which type
of Collection it will use internally.

<P>
Collection-related classes elsewhere in FLEX will eventually be
cleaned up, organized, and migrated into this package so that all
Collections-related code is kept together.  
This package has been spun off into their own library,
<a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/~cananian/Projects/JUtil/">JUtil</a>,
if you want to use them in other work.
