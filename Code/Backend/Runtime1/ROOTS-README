The requirement that something be in the class-root is that someone
does an 'instanceof' or 'FindClass' operation on the class 
*in native code*.  If it is in java bytecode, then it is a bug in
the QuadClassHierarchy that it didn't find the class.  If someone
does create a new *instance* of the object *in native code* then
the *constructor* which is invoked belongs in the *method roots*.
One way or another, the entry should have a comment indicating why
the class or method is a root --- where it is called, etc.

Jikes, however, generates 
Class.forName("[Ljava.lang.ClassLoader;").getComponentType()
when it encounters ClassLoader.class whereas javac generates
Class.forName("java.lang.ClassLoader;")

Since Class.forName doesn't create an instance, and getComponentType()
is called on it, the requirement is that the class be compiled, but not
necessarily <init>.  Thus, it does belong in class-root.
