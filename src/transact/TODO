 (use wnext from the struct vinfo containing the hashtable)
 potential problem is that this leaves us w/o any way to indicate
 that a FLAG-valued entry really *is* valid.  Partial solution: copy the
 direct_fields (easy enough) and use an extra bit in the hash table
 key to indicate whether entry is valid (or use extra bit to
 indicate 'ignore the value, the entry is FLAG').  Runs into
 problems with doing a safe SC on the version, which is needed
 for copyback.  No way to do a single atomic action to set a
 field to FLAG/reset a field from FLAG.
X copy back on arrays must deal with fact that read flag corresponds
X  to a number of different array elements (every 32, in fact).
X  can't clear read bit until *all* of these have been copied back. =(
X ensureWriter needs to use type reflection to determine the proper
X  createVersion type, as the static type may be inaccurate (reports
X  Object for boolean[], for example)
----
double-check that copyback works properly even when old committed
   version stays linked
   xxx we do a copy back, and the the value is set to FLAG again,
   causing an incorrect fallback to the previous value.  need to
   reset versioned values to FLAG after a successful copy-back.
   really need to do an atomic swap of the two values.
what about copyback when the "real" value is FLAG?

Setting canonical value to flag.
 1) from scratch
 2) copy-back of a FLAG committed value.
  -- have to ensure that all versions have FLAG as well.
  -- different from regular copy back.

Setting a canonical FLAG value to non-flag.
  -- recognizing when copy-back is sucessful.

----------- known bugs --------------
1) Must compile like so:
bin/build-precisec -Dharpoon.synctrans.nofieldoracle=true -Dharpoon.synctrans.nocheckoracle=true -T Hello HICT00
  because created WriteVersion created by the object check
  may get wiped out by the object check for a read version on the same
   object; the read version check sets the version to NULL.
  need some way of sensibly combining the two, so that the
   initialization to NULL occurs *only* if the version is otherwise
   undefined (maybe hoist all read initializations to top; not sure
   how well the register allocator will handle that)
  XXX note that 'read version' is *PER FIELD*  ... fix readNT
  Also need to invalidate read version for subtran commit.
2) resizing is foobarred; need to resize can happen in weird places
   because of how subtransaction-versioning works.

--- later ---
snip 'next' fields of version lists when committed
 careful -- someone may race and read 'next', not knowing version
 has been committed while it wasn't looking.  handle this case
 w/ a retry
"quick" versions of methods suitable for inlining which handle
 the common case and then call the regular version otherwise?
move versions and readers list into object (out of infl_object)
figure out the 'readers' list in the vinfo structure.
 readers list per trans, as opposed to global readers list.
[actually, probably not *too* hard to change _Array versions of
   read/write to allow 1 bit field for every element of the array at
   the start of the array: we just offset element_start to give us
   room.  ANEW's allocation would have to be tweaked, as well.]

Figure out exactly what sorts of outstanding transactions we allow.
We'd *like* single-writer, multiple-reader, but is this really
what we have?

Transaction list contains at most ONE outstanding or aborted transaction
(and its outstanding, committed, or aborted subtransactions on anext edges)
followed (on the wnext edge) by a COMMITTED transaction (and its
committed subtransactions on wnext edges).  Alternatively, the
transactions list may be completely empty.  (But if there
*are* transactions on the list, a COMMITTED transaction *must*
anchor the chain).
  to-do: re-read code and make sure this is consistent.
   in particular, does CopyBackAndKill recognize that
   it may leave a version attached?

handle aborts correctly: i.e. don't try to add yourself as a reader
or make a new writer version if you're dead! (this includes your
parents).  however, no harm done if you keep writing to your own
version even after it's dead.  but you shouldn't start killing
other people, certainly.

gcc -I../../include -c test.c


GUARANTEES:
a. to set FLAG field to non-FLAG: (can't race with b)
   a) read bits are set (prevents races from writeNT)
   b) put your unique nonce on the head of the versions chain.
   c) check that field is still FLAG
   d) conditional on your nonce still being at head of the chain,
      set the field to the new value.
      (prevents races from others trying to set FLAG to non-FLAG)

b. to set non-FLAG field to FLAG: (can't race with a)
   0) versions list must be non-null?
   b) look at header
   a)  set read flag. (now writes to the field must first clear read flag)
   c)  field must be non-FLAG at this point.
   c)  copy canonical value across to all versions, cond. on header same.
   d) conditional on header still being the same, store the FLAG.

c. to set field to any value (even FLAG?), read flags must be cleared.
   (writeNT)

d. to clear read flag:
   a) set the head of the versions chain to a unique nonce, unless it
      is NULL
   b) check that the reader list is NULL
   c) clear the flag conditional on the head of the versions chain.
      -e- this means we might overwrite a flag set by a call to
          setReadFlags() -- but the transaction involved was on the
          readers list and is now aborted, so no matter.
      -d- not a big deal if flag gets inadvertently reset by this race
      -c- n/a
      -a-/-b- protected by the head of the version chain

e. to add a reader to the reader list
   a) if head of reader list is NULL, must add nonce to versions chain.

f. can always set a read flag:
   a) transaction involved in the readers list
   b) field must be non-FLAG [may change before step (c) ]
   c) atomically update read flag.

xxx: should never alter a value in a committed transaction?
