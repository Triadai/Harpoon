This work is based partially on the ideas explored by Steven Howard in a previous program.
It has been completely rewritten from scratch and extended by Wes Beebee.

The following sub-packages provide the implementation of the image recognition program:
<ul>
  <li><code>corba</code></li>
  <li><code>graph</code></li>
  <li><code>rtj</code></li>
  <li><code>util</code></li>
</ul>
