This package has first-class composable nodes that contain stages of
the image recognition process.  The design idea is to deemphasize the
amount of processing at each node to increase the ability to 
combinatorially explore the space of image recognition pipelines 
through top-level directed graph construction (in src/Main.java).

<p>Through dataflow, precise callgraph construction, method specialization,
and inlining, the overhead of using this design technique becomes zero.

<p>Using the Display, Copy, and Node nodes, the output of each stage can be 
examined without disturbing the pipeline.  Thus, problems in the
pipeline can be easily addressed.

<p>Furthermore, Client and Server nodes allow splitting the pipeline at
arbitrary points (even dynamically!) to adjust load at different
places in the network.  Sending nodes across the network permits
dynamic reconfiguration through changing pipeline topography.
That is why all Nodes are Serializable.

<p>Also, nodes can be changed depending on the type of object tracked,
permitting dynamic specialization of the pipeline during tracking.
