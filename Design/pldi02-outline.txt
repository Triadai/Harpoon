% outline for paper.
% introduction
% header optimizations
%  discussion of typical object layout.
%  claz compression.
%  hashcode/lock compression.
%   analyses for doing so; static/dynamic hash counts.
% field compression.
%  description of bitwidth analysis.
%   treatment of loops.
%   constant/unread fields.
%   scc.  crib from thesis.
%   interprocedural.  no appreciable gain from context sensitivity.
%   no pointer analysis to discriminate object classes (yea, type-safety)
%  implementation: bit/byte/java-type packing.
% sub-topic: pointer compression.
%  present numbers: how your memory stacks up.
% mostly-zero field analysis.
%  as extension: mostly-'N'
%  techniques:
%   dynamic specialization
%    analyses required.
%   ``external fields''
%    profiling/analyses required.
%    implementation of external hashtable.
% results/discussion.
%  present sum totals.
%  compress doesn't do so hot: show why.
% conclusion/future work.
%  better pointer analysis/separate out classes of objects.
%   (strings as motivating example: compress to byte[])
%  other stuff?
