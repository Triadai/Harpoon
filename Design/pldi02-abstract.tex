\begin{abstract}

This paper presents a set of Java optimizations targetted at
memory-constrained embedded devices.  We aggressively transform
the program using both source-level transformations and
specializations of the runtime environment to save as much
as {\bf XX}\% of the storage requested by the allocator.

Our techniques fall into three broad categories: header optimizations,
bitwidth analyses, and mostly-zero field elimination.  Header
optimizations reduce the size penalties associated with virtual
dispatch and Java hashcode and locking semantics.  Bitwidth
analyses allow static compile-time reduction of field sizes where the
full range of a datatype is unused.  Mostly-zero field elimination
attempts to factor out fields which are ``usually zero'' (as
determined by profiling) to obtain savings.  Combined, these
techniques free the programmer from the burden of space accounting
and allow the use of general-purpose software on extremely
memory-constrained embedded devices.
