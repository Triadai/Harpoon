Why Java is good:
 - you figure it out.  Strong type system.  Well-defined, but simple,
   OO language.
 - built-in threading.
Why Java is bad:
 - no bitwidth specs on types (solve with smart compiler)
 - no real time specs (no timing info at all)
 - no i/o grammar
-----------------------
Passes:
 - extended type analysis
 - bitwidth analysis

MAINTAIN hierarchical/macroblock hardware structure.
