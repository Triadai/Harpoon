\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a new intermediate format, 
Static Single Information (SSI) form. In addition
to traditional variable definition points, SSI
form provides new names for each variable at
each point where the analysis may obtain
information about the value in the variable. 
The form provides excellent support for predicated analyses,
which use the information present in conditional
branches, because it enables the analyses to propagate
information directly from information definition sites
to information use sites.

We have implemented a Java compiler that uses SSI
form as its primary intermediate representation, and
implemented a variety of analyses using the form.
These analyses include redundant array bounds and null pointer check analyses, a 
conditional constant
propagation analysis, and a bit-width analysis. Our experimental
results show that the analyses execute efficiently and extract
information that can be used to significantly optimize the
program. Furthermore, we believe that SSI form significantly
simplified the efficient implementation of these analyses.
