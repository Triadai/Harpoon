\begin{abstract}

This paper presents a new intermediate format called
Static Single Information (SSI) form. SSI form generalizes
the traditional concept of a variable definition to 
include all {\em information definition points}, or points 
where the analysis may obtain information about the value in
a variable. Information definition points include 
conditional branches as well as assignments. Because SSI
form provides a new name for each variable at each information definition
point, it provides excellent support for both 
{\em predicated analyses}, which exploit information gained
from conditionals, and backwards dataflow analyses.

We have developed a Java compiler that uses SSI form as
its primary program representation. We have used SSI form
to implement several predicated analyses, including 
redundant array bounds and null pointer check analyses, a conditional constant
propagation analysis, and a bit-width analysis. Our experimental
results show that the analyses execute efficiently and extract
information that can be used to significantly optimize the
program. Furthermore, we believe that SSI form significantly
simplified the efficient implementation of these analyses.
