GNU Classpath README - Last updated: December 23, 2002

GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is a project to create
a complete "clean room" implementation of the Java class libraries 
that will also be free software.  Additionally GNU Classpath now includes
a sub-project called GNU Classpath Tools whose goal is to provide 
a number of free replacements for standard Java development tools like
javadoc, javap, javah, and others.

Eventually, these essential libraries for Java will work with as many 
free JVMs as possible.  Virtual machines known to use GNU Classpath
include:
	* GCJ 		(http://gcc.gnu.org/java/)
	* ORP		(http://orp.sourceforge.net/)
	* Kissme	(http://kissme.sourceforge.net/)
	* SableVM	(http://www.sablevm.org/)
	* Jupiter	(http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~doylep/jupiter/)
	* Joas		(http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/jaos/)
	* AegisVM	(http://aegisvm.sourceforge.net/)

This is a development release only and is not ready for general
purpose use.

Most JVMs come with their own customized version of GNU Classpath.
Please check if there is a customised version available for the JVM you
use before trying the bare bones GNU Classpath release. We are working with
the JVM creators to keep the differences between the core classes as small
as possible. Please tell us if you make GNU Classpath work with a new JVM.

See the file INSTALL for details on installing GNU Classpath.
See the file NEWS for details on what is included in this release.
See the file TODO for the latest to do list.
See the file HACKING for working on (non-released) CVS development versions.
