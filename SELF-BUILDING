To build FLEX with FLEX, the first thing you must do is make sure
the .class binaries are linked against a 1.1 JDK -- there are some
methods (StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer), for example, used in
TreeToC method 'flushAndAppend' among other places) which were
added after JDK1.1.  References to these post-1.1 methods should
not be present in your class binaries:


$ make clean
$ export OLDCP="$CLASSPATH"
$ export CLASSPATH=.:SupportNP/collections.jar:SupportNP/classes.zip
$ make jikes
$ export CLASSPATH="$OLDCP"
$ bin/build-precisec harpoon.Main.SAMain SAMAIN

The compilation of the C source files generated by FLEX's precisec
backend uses quite a lot ( > 64M ) of space in /tmp (or /usr/tmp).
Set the environment variable TMPDIR to point to somewhere where you've
got plenty of space free, if /tmp is crowded:

$ TMPDIR=/var/tmp bin/build-precisec harpoon.Main.SAMain SAMAIN
