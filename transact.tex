\section{Data Structures}

Transaction support uses the same ``inflated object'' extension
mechanism which is used for thread synchronization, clustered heaps,
JNI data, and finalization for certain garbage collectors.
The basic object data structure, as shown in figure \ref{fig:oobj}, is
unchanged, although fields containing the specified
\texttt{FLAG\_VALUE} have different semantics.  The flag value is used
to indicate that the field value is ``not here''; that is, the code
must consult the transaction information to find the field's current
value.  This happens very rarely even when no transaction is
associated with the object; Shasta \cite{scales96:shasta} has shown that the
overhead entailed by such ``false'' transactions is expected to be
extremely low.

The ``inflated object'' data structure, shown in figure
\ref{fig:infl}, has a simple ``object versions'' linked list associated with
it.  Each entry conceptually stores information about a different,
possibly-uncommitted, version of the object.  One of these versions is
guaranteed to be ``most recent committed'', and it is guaranteed that
the ``most recent committed'' version will be the first committed
version in the list.

Note that the ``object version'' structure, shown in figure
\ref{fig:version}, is the same size as the object structure shown in
figure \ref{fig:oobj}, so that the same field offsets can be used.
In addition, the \texttt{vinfo} structure contains a ``next'' field
(as it is a singly linked list) and a pointer to a commit record which
identifies the transaction which this version is part of.  This allows
client code to determine which version it should address.

The commit record structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:commitrec}.
The pointer to the commit record also serves as a transaction
identifier.  Transactions can be nested, therefore every commit record
may contain a pointer to a ``parent'' transaction which it is
dependent upon.  The commit record also contains a three-value
``status'' field which indicates whether the transaction it represents
has been committed or aborted yet.

We can also chain commit records together using the ``waiting'' field
of the \texttt{commitrec} structure to more efficiently restart
transactions which aborted because of reservations held by this
one.  Experimentation will determine whether this is worthwhile or
whether a simple exponential backoff scheme will work better.
If this field is used, it is expected to link multiple ``aborted''
commit records to a single ``waiting'' record at the head.  When the
record at the head is either committed or aborted, the other
transactions should be restarted.

In practice, this will probably work better if there is a condition
value/mutex pair associated with every commit record which
transactions would signal when aborting or commiting --- but this
seems to entail too much overhead.  We don't want to have to
\texttt{pthread\_mutex\_lock} and \texttt{pthread\_cond\_signal} at every
transaction commit/abort, do we?
