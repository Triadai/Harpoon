Provides the classes for working with and generating Collections of
Objects. 

The purpose of the harpoon.Util.Collections package is to collect
together all of our Collections-related classes. 

One key portion of the Collections package are the various Collection
factories, which are designed to allow code to parameterize which type
of Collection it will use internally.

<P>
Collection-related classes in harpoon.Util will eventually be migrated
into this package so that all Collections-related code is kept
together.
