Provides the classes for working with and generating Collections
and Graphs of Objects (mostly migrated to the stand-alone
<a href="http://cscott.net/Projects/JUtil/">JUtil package</a>).
<p>
The purpose of the <code>harpoon.Util.Collections</code> package is to collect
together all of our Collections-related classes. 
<p>
One key portion of the Collections package are the various collection
factories, which are designed to allow code to parameterize which type
of Collection it will use internally.
<P>
Collection-related classes elsewhere in FLEX will eventually be
cleaned up, organized, and migrated into this package so that all
Collections-related code is kept together.  
<p>
This package has been spun off into its own library,
<a href="http://cscott.net/Projects/JUtil/">JUtil</a>,
if you want to use it in other work.
