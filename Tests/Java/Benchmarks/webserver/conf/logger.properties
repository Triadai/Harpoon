# Enable/disable Apache JServ logging.
# WARNING: logging is a very expensive operation in terms of performance. You
# should reduced the generated log to a minumum or even disable it if fast 
# execution is an issue.  Note that if all log channels (see below) are
# enabled, the log may become really big since each servlet request may
# generate many Kb of log. Some log channels are mainly for debugging
# purposes and should be disabled in a production environment.
# Syntax: log=[true,false] (boolean)
# Default: true
log=true

# Set the name of the trace/log file.  To avoid possible confusion about
# the location of this file, an absolute pathname is recommended.
# 
# This log file is different than the log file that is in the
# jserv.conf file. This is the log file for the Java portion of Apache
# JServ.
#
# On Unix, this file must have write permissions by the owner of the JVM
# process. In other words, if you are running Apache JServ in manual mode
# and Apache is running as user nobody, then the file must have its
# permissions set so that that user can write to it.
# Syntax: log.file=[log path and filename] (String)
# Default: NONE
# Note: if the file could not be opened, try using absolute paths.
log.file=hit.log

# Enable the timestamp before the log message
# Syntax: log.timestamp=[true,false] (boolean)
# Default: true
log.timestamp=true

# Use the given string as a data format 
# (see java.text.SimpleDateFormat for the list of options)
# Syntax: log.dateFormat=(String)
# Default: [dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss:SSS zz]
log.dateFormat=[dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss:SSS zz]
 
# Syntax: log.queue.maxage = [milliseconds]
# Default: 5000
log.queue.maxage = 5000

# Syntax: log.queue.maxsize = [integer]
# Default: 1000
log.queue.maxsize = 1000
