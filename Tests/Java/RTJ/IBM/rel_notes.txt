INTRODUCTION

VisualAge Micro Edition consists of an integrated development 
environment and other tools and runtimes that help you develop 
embedded Java (TM) applications.

Additional support information may be available at 
news://news.software.ibm.com/ibm.software.vame.

==================================================================
1.  What's New
==================================================================

This version of the J9 VM Real-Time Extensions is now compatible
with the QNX RTP environment.  This release also corrects memory
checking and improves memory control and thread behavior.  For 
information about J9 VMs for other platforms, see:
www.ibm.com/embedded

The Real-Time Extensions are defined by The Real-Time 
Specification for Java. This specification, available at 
www.rtj.org, defines classes and APIs that extend deterministic, 
performance, and memory access related capabilities typical to
real-time development. This package provides the initial 
implementation of this specification for the J9 Virtual Machine
(VM). This initial implementation is for the X86 Neutrino 
platform only.


==================================================================
2.  Package
==================================================================

The following are included in this package:
rte.jar                 - Real-Time library with source
rtetests.jar            - Real-Time tests with source
memspaces.jar           - Memory space libraries with source
natives.zip             - Native C source code for RTE implementation
Realtime Extensions     - VisualAge MicroEdition workspace
doc/index.html          - Documentation for Real-Time implementation
j9x86rte/j9 and *.so    - Modified x86 Neutrino 1.2 J9 VM and shared 
                          objects


The rte.jar file contains the class and source code for the 
implementation of The Real-Time Specification for Java. The 
rtetests.jar file contains the class and source code for tests to 
exercise the rte.jar implementation. Note that since the Real-Time
Extensions are still in development, not all of the tests complete
successfully. The memspaces.jar library defines the classes and
APIs for creating and using Memory Spaces with the J9 VM. The 
natives.zip file contains the C source code showing some of the
RTE implementation for the VM.  The extensions use the standard 
VisualAge Micro Edition 1.2 jclMax class library. The standard 
class libraries have not been modified for the Real-Time 
Extensions. Finally, the J9 VM and shared objects is a modified 
version for use with the Real-Time Extensions.



==================================================================
3.  Running Examples and Tests
==================================================================

The rtetests.jar file contains several test classes that exercise
the areas of the Real-Time Extensions. Each of the following
tests assumes all of the library *.jar and *.zip files are in the
current directory with the included J9 VM and that the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment parameter is set to this directory.

3.1 Calltests
These are basic tests to instantiate and call each public method
and field defined in the specification. This test can be run as
follows:

./j9 -bp:classes.zip -cp:rte.jar:memspaces.jar:rtetests.jar javax.realtime.calltests.Tests


3.2 Memory Tests
There are three areas currently tested in memory; memory spaces, 
memory creation, and raw memory access. These tests can be run
with the following commands:

./j9 -bp:classes.zip -cp:rte.jar:memspaces.jar:rtetests.jar javax.realtime.memtests.MemTest
./j9 -bp:classes.zip -cp:rte.jar:memspaces.jar:rtetests.jar javax.realtime.memtests.MemSpaceTest
./j9 -bp:classes.zip -cp:rte.jar:memspaces.jar:rtetests.jar javax.realtime.memtests.RawMemTest

Note that both the MemSpaceTest and RawMemTest will take several
seconds before providing test result output.


3.3 Thread Test
This test creates a user-defined number of RealtimeThreads of 
various priorities and executes them in a loop. This test can
be run as follows (where [int] is an integer number for threads
to be run):

./j9 -bp:classes.zip -cp:rte.jar:memspaces.jar:rtetests.jar javax.realtime.threadtests.ThreadBasher [int]


==================================================================
4.  Realtime Extensions Workspace
==================================================================

Included in this package is a VisualAge Micro Edition 1.2 IDE 
Workspace.  This workspace is populated with the Real-Time 
Extensions, Memory Spaces, and Tests source code.  This workspace
can be used to read the source and add a project for development.
Some modification may be required to the workspace, depending
on your installation.  

Open the workspace with the VisualAge Micro Edition IDE.  From the 
Workbench window select the Workspace menu, then Properties.  From
Properties, select the Class Path tab.  In the Class Path tab 
window select JCL Max.  Verify the Execution path is set correctly
for your installation.  If not, click on the Browse window and 
select the jclMax 1.2 library.  Repeat these steps for each of the
libraries in this window.

Again, from the Workbench window, select the Workspace menu.  
Choose Administration->Change Workspace User.  From the Change
User window type in the appropriate user information.  This will
allow normal access to your repository and team streams if
applicable. 

If you do not have the VisualAge Micro Edition 1.2 tools, 
including the IDE, it can be downloaded at:

www.ibm.com/embedded


==================================================================
5.  Known Limitations
==================================================================

The Real-Time Extensions continue to be developed, and this beta
package is an incomplete implementation of the specification. 
Areas that are incomplete include Synchronization, Asynchrony, and
Security. While these areas are partially implemented, please
verify in the rte.jar library which methods have been completed.
Also note that with these areas, the Java source may be 
implemented in the library but the associated capabilities are 
not in the VM.
