1. grants to each Community Member a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide and royalty-free license to the extent of such Community Member's copyrights and trade secret rights in and covering its Contributed Code, to reproduce, modify, display and distribute Contributed Code, in whole or in part, in source code and object code form, to the same extent as permitted under such Community Member's License with Original Contributor (including all supplements thereto).

2. will not at any time bring against any Community Member any claim alleging that using, making, having made, importing or distributing Contributed Code as permitted under this License (including any supplements) infringes any patents or patent applications now owned or hereafter acquired by such Community Member which patents or patent applications are infringed by using, making, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring the Contributed Code ("Community Member Patents"). This covenant shall apply to the combination of the Contributed Code with other Covered Code if, at the time the Contributed Code is posted, such addition of the Contributed Code causes such combination to be covered by the Community Member Patents. The covenant shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contributed Code or to the use or distribution of modified Contributed Code where the modifications made by the Community Member add to the functions performed by the Contributed Code in question and where, in the absence of such modifications, there would be no infringement of a Community Member Patent.

3. grants to Original Contributor, in addition to the rights set forth in Sections III.B.1 and III.B.2, the right to sublicense all such rights in Contributed Code, in whole or in part, as part of Reference Code or other technologies based in whole or in part on Reference Code or Technology and to copy, distribute, modify and prepare derivative works of Contributed Code Specifications, in whole or in part, in connection with the exercise of such rights.

C. Subcontracting. You may provide Covered Code to a contractor for the sole purpose of providing development services exclusively to You consistent with Your rights under this License. Such Contractor must be a Community Member or have executed an agreement with You that is consistent with Your rights and obligations under this License.

A. Source Code Availability. You must provide source code and any specifications for Your Error Corrections to Original Contributor as soon as practicable. You may provide other Contributed Code to Original Contributor at any time, in Your discretion. Original Contributor may, in its discretion, post Your Contributed Code and Contributed Code Specifications on the Technology Site. You may post Your Contributed Code and/or Contributed Code Specifications on another website of Your choice; provided, source code of Community Code and Technology Specifications must be provided to Community Members only and only following certification of Community Member status as required under Section IV.D.

B. Notices. You must reproduce without alteration copyright and other proprietary notices in any Covered Code that You distribute. The statement, "Use and Distribution is subject to the TimeSys Community Source License available at http://www.timesys.com/tcsl.html" must appear prominently in Your Modifications and, in all cases, in the same file as all Your copyright and other proprietary notices. 

C. Modifications. You must include a diff file with Your Contributed Code that identifies and details the changes or additions You made, the version of Reference Code or Contributed Code You used and the date of such changes or additions. In addition, You must provide any Contributed Code Specifications for Your Contributed Code. Your Modifications are Covered Code and You expressly agree that use and distribution, in whole or in part, of Your Modifications shall only be done in accordance with and subject to this License.

D. Distribution Requirements. You may distribute object code of Covered Code to third parties for Research Use only pursuant to a license of Your choice which is consistent with this License. You may distribute source code of Covered Code and the Technology Specifications for Research Use only to (i) Community Members from whom You have first obtained a certification of status in the form set forth in Attachment A-1, and (ii) students from whom You have first obtained an executed acknowledgment in the form set forth in Attachment A-2. You must keep a copy of each such certificate and acknowledgment You obtain and provide a copy to Original Contributor, if requested. 

E. Extensions.
1. You may create and add Interfaces but, unless expressly permitted at the Technology Site, You must not incorporate any Reference Code in Your Interfaces. If You choose to disclose or permit disclosure of Your Interfaces to even a single third party for the purposes of enabling such third party to independently develop and distribute (directly or indirectly) technology which invokes such Interfaces, You must then make the Interfaces open by (a) promptly following completion thereof, publishing to the industry, on a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright restrictions, a reasonably detailed, current and accurate specification for the Interfaces, and (b) as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event more than thirty (30) days following publication of Your specification, making available on reasonable terms and without discrimination, a reasonably complete and practicable test suite and methodology adequate to create and test implementations of the Interfaces by a reasonably skilled technologist.

2. You shall not assert any intellectual property rights You may have covering Your Interfaces which would necessarily be infringed by the creation, use or distribution of all reasonable independent implementations of Your specification of such Interfaces by a Community Member or Original Contributor. Nothing herein is intended to prevent You from enforcing any of Your intellectual property rights covering Your specific implementation of Your Interfaces or functionality using such Interfaces other than as specifically set forth in this Section IV.E.2.

V. GOVERNANCE.

A. License Versions.

C. Limitation Of Liability.
1. Infringement. Each Community Member disclaims any liability to all other Community Members for claims brought by any third party based on infringement of intellectual property rights. Original Contributor represents that, to its knowledge, it has sufficient copyrights to allow You to use and distribute the Reference Code as herein permitted (including as permitted in any Supplement hereto) and You represent that, to Your knowledge, You have sufficient copyrights to allow each Community Member and Original Contributor to use and distribute Your Shared Modifications and Error Corrections as herein permitted (including as permitted in any supplements to the License). 

2. Disclaimer. EACH COMMUNITY MEMBER'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR ANY SUPPLEMENT HERETO, WHETHER FOR BREACH OR TORT, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (US$1000.00) OR THE FULL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE MATERIALS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, IF ANY. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA OR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OF ANY SORT), HOWEVER IT ARISES AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (including negligence), WHETHER OR NOT ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.

D. Termination.
You may terminate this License at any time by notifying Original Contributor in writing.

All Your rights will terminate under this License if You fail to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and do not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

If You institute patent litigation against a Community Member with respect to a patent applicable to Community Code, then any patent licenses or covenants granted by such Community Member to You under this License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if You institute patent litigation against any Community Member or Original Contributor alleging that Reference Code, Technology or Technology Specifications infringe Your patent(s), then the rights granted to You under this License and any supplement hereto will terminate.

Upon termination, You must discontinue all uses and distribution of Community Code, except that You may continue to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, display and perform Your Modifications, so long as the license grants and covenants of this license are not required to do so. Properly granted sublicenses to third parties will survive termination. 

Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect following termination survive.

E. Miscellaneous.
1. Integration. This License represents the complete agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof.

2. Severability. If any provision of this License is held unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable unless to do so would defeat the intent of the parties, in which case, this License shall terminate.

3. Governing Law. This License is governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as applied to contracts entered into and performed in California between California residents. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. Nor shall any law or regulation which provides that a contract be construed against the drafter.

a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this License shall be finally settled by arbitration as set forth in this Section, except that either party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction (which jurisdiction shall be exclusive), relative to any dispute relating to such party's intellectual property rights. Arbitration will be administered (i) by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), (ii) in accordance with the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) (the "Rules") in effect at the time of arbitration, modified as set forth herein, and (iii) by an arbitrator described in Section 5.b who shall apply the governing laws required under Section V.E.4 above. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction to enforce such award. The arbitrator must not award damages in excess of or of a different type than those permitted by this License and any such award is void.

b) All proceedings will be in English and conducted by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Rules who is fluent in English, familiar with technology matters pertinent in the dispute and is either a retired judge or practicing attorney having at least ten (10) years litigation experience. Venue for arbitration will be in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, unless the parties agree otherwise. Each party will be required to produce documents relied upon in the arbitration and to respond to no more than twenty-five single question interrogatories. All awards are payable in US dollars and may include for the prevailing party (i) pre-judgment interest, (ii) reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration, and (iii) reasonable costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the award.
