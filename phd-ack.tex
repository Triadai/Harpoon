%The infinite patience of my advisor, family, and friends.
I would like to thank my advisor Martin Rinard for his infinite
patience, and for his guidance and support.  I would like to thank Tom
Knight for pointing me in the direction of transactional memory many
years ago, and Charles Leiserson, Bradley Kuszmaul, Krste Asonovi\'c,
and Sean Lie for the opportunity to collaborate on research into
hardware transactional memory.
