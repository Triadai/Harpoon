%The infinite patience of my advisor, family, and friends.
I would like to thank my advisor Martin Rinard for his infinite
patience, and for his guidance and support.  I would like to thank Tom
Knight for pointing me in the direction of transactional memory many
years ago, and Charles Leiserson, Bradley Kuszmaul, Krste Asanovi\'c,
and Sean Lie for the opportunity to collaborate on our
hardware transactional memory research.

A list of thanks would not be complete without
my ``officemates'' (real or virtual) who made my
years at LCS and CSAIL so enjoyable: Maria-Cristina Marinescu (\#2),
Radu Rugina (\#3), Darko Marinov (\#5), Brian Demsky (\#6), Alex
Salcianu (\#7), Karen Zee (\#8), Patrick Lam (\#10), Viktor Kuncak (\#11), 
Amy Williams (\#13), and Angelina Lee (who somehow has no number).

My mother, Cyndy Bernotas, waited a long time for this thesis to be
complete.  My brother, Chris Ananian, profited by the delay and became
the first Dr.~Ananian---but didn't rub it in too much.
Jessica Wong and Kathy Peter put up with my
indefinite studenthood.  Thank you.
