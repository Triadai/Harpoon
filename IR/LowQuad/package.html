A low-level quadruple-based IR.
<p>
Low-quad form allows pointer-based optimizations that are impossible
to perform in hi-quad form.  As an example, low-quad form allows the
optimization of:
<XMP>
void foo(int arr[]) {
  for (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++)
    arr[i] = 42;
}
</XMP>
which is implemented as something like:
<XMP>
void foo(int arr[]) {
  for (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++)
    *(arr+i) = 42;
}
</XMP>
to the more efficient:
<XMP>
void foo(int arr[]) {
  for (int *i=arr; i<arr+arr.length; i++)
    *i = 42;
}
</XMP>
Note that there is also pointer-scaling going on here which it is
difficult to write in C.
<p>
Note that a <code>harpoon.IR.Properties.Derivation</code> must be
maintained in low-quad form to allow compiler-supported garbage
collection in the back-end.
