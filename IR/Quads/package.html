A flat, typed, high-level quadruple-based IR.
<p>
Quad form is used for most analysis and transformation in the
compiler.  It maintains strong typing, and tries to be minimal.
There are three main variants:<UL>

<LI><code>QuadWithTry</code>, which contains <code>HANDLER</code>
quads to handle thrown exceptions, and does implicit safety-checking.

<LI><code>QuadNoSSA</code> which handles all exceptions explicitly.

<LI><code>QuadSSA</code> which is the same as the above, except it is
in <A HREF="http://flexc.lcs.mit.edu/Harpoon/thesis.pdf">SSI form</a>.

</UL>
<p>
These varieties are somewhat misnamed; hopefully this will be fixed
soon.
For lower-level transformations involving explicit pointer arithmetic,
<code>LowQuad</code> form must be used.
