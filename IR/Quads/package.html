A flat, typed, high-level quadruple-based IR.
<p>
Quad form is used for most analysis and transformation in the
compiler.  It maintains strong typing, and tries to be minimal.
There are three main variants, and an additional variant which is
occasionally useful as an intermediate:<UL>

<LI><code>QuadWithTry</code>, which contains <code>HANDLER</code>
quads to handle thrown exceptions, and does implicit safety-checking.

<LI><code>QuadNoSSA</code> which handles all exceptions explicitly.

<LI><code>QuadSSI</code> which is the same as the above, except it is
in <A HREF="http://flexc.lcs.mit.edu/Harpoon/thesis.pdf">SSI form</a>.

<LI><code>QuadRSSI</code> is a relaxed version of
<code>QuadSSI</code>; during program transformations it is sometimes
easier to break the phi/sigma constraints of SSI form without doing
a full translation to/from <code>QuadNoSSA</code>.  Relaxed-SSI (RSSI)
form is what we call this "SSI form with broken constraints".
</UL>
<p>
For lower-level transformations involving explicit pointer arithmetic,
<code>LowQuad</code> form must be used.
