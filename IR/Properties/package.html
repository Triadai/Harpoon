This package contains interfaces defining various properties of an
intermediate representation.
<p>
The design concept here is to keep the basic IR simple, and only
implement the properties relevant to the IR.  The analyses in
<code>harpoon.Analysis</code> will work with any IR, as long as
it implements the properties which the analysis requires.
